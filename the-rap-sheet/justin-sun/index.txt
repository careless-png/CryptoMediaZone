3:T70e,Justin Sun is the closest thing crypto has to a cockroach  -  and he'd probably take that as a compliment. The TRON founder, BitTorrent acquirer, and Grenadian diplomat has been accused of fraud, market manipulation, and wash trading by the SEC. He's been investigated by multiple countries. And yet he continues to operate, tweet, and provoke as though nothing has happened.

In March 2023, the SEC charged Sun with offering and selling unregistered securities (TRX and BTT tokens), fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through wash trading, and orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to promote tokens without proper disclosure. The celebrities  -  including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and Soulja Boy  -  were also charged.

Sun's alleged wash trading was brazen. The SEC claimed his team conducted over 600,000 wash trades of TRX tokens over a six-month period, generating $31 million in artificial volume. He also allegedly paid celebrities millions to promote TRX and BTT on social media without disclosing the payments  -  a straight-up securities law violation.

But here's the thing about Justin Sun: nothing sticks. He lives outside US jurisdiction (Grenada, Singapore, Hong Kong  -  it varies). He holds a diplomatic passport from Grenada, which complicates any arrest attempts. He continues to acquire companies (he bought Poloniex, a steak restaurant at a Sotheby's auction, and has spent millions on NFT art). His Twitter feed remains a chaotic mix of self-promotion, provocative takes, and buffet photos.

The SEC case remains pending. Multiple other countries have investigated his operations. Yet Justin Sun remains free, operational, and seemingly unbothered. Whether that's because he's genuinely untouchable or because the clock hasn't run out yet remains to be seen.5:["slug","justin-sun","d"]
