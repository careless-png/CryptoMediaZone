3:T68d,Roger Ver was crypto's first celebrity. In the early 2010s, he was the loudest, most passionate Bitcoin evangelist alive  -  earning the nickname "Bitcoin Jesus." He invested in some of crypto's earliest companies: Blockchain.com, Kraken, BitPay, Ripple. He reportedly held around 400,000 BTC at one point. He was a true believer before anyone else.

Then came the block size wars. Ver became the most vocal advocate for larger Bitcoin blocks and eventually threw his weight behind Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in the 2017 fork. He called BCH "the real Bitcoin." The Bitcoin community, which had once revered him, turned hostile. He went from Bitcoin Jesus to Bitcoin Judas overnight.

Ver renounced his US citizenship in 2014, becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. He moved to Japan. This is where the legal trouble starts: US authorities allege that when Ver renounced his citizenship, he was required to pay an "exit tax" on unrealized gains from his crypto holdings. They claim he undervalued his Bitcoin holdings by approximately $48 million to avoid taxes.

In April 2024, Ver was arrested in Spain on a US criminal indictment for mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The charges stem from his 2014 expatriation. The DOJ alleges he concealed his Bitcoin holdings from the IRS while renouncing citizenship.

Ver has fought extradition and maintained his innocence, arguing that the US tax code wasn't designed for crypto assets and that he made good-faith efforts to comply. Regardless of the outcome, the arc is striking: the man who did more than anyone to popularize Bitcoin in its earliest days now faces prison for how he handled those very same Bitcoin.5:["slug","roger-ver","d"]
