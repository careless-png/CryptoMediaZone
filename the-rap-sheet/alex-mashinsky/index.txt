3:T661,Alex Mashinsky was a serial entrepreneur who co-invented VOIP technology (voice over internet protocol) and then decided to apply his talents to financial fraud. In 2017, he founded Celsius Network with the catchphrase "unbank yourself"  -  a crypto lending platform that offered depositors yields of up to 18% on their crypto.

Mashinsky cultivated a folksy, man-of-the-people persona. He wore Celsius t-shirts, did weekly AMA videos, and personally reassured depositors that their funds were safe. He told customers Celsius was "safer than a bank." Behind the scenes, he was gambling their deposits on risky DeFi plays, loaning to funds like Three Arrows Capital, and personally withdrawing tens of millions.

When 3AC collapsed in June 2022, Celsius's house of cards followed. The platform froze all withdrawals on June 13, 2022, trapping $4.7 billion in customer funds. Mashinsky initially told customers it was a temporary pause. It was not temporary. Celsius filed for bankruptcy a month later.

Court filings revealed the extent of the deception. Mashinsky had personally withdrawn $68 million in crypto in the months before the freeze  -  while telling customers everything was fine. He manipulated the CEL token price. He lied about the platform's financial health. The bankruptcy examiner's report was damning.

Mashinsky was arrested in July 2023 on fraud charges. In December 2024, he pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison. The judge noted that Mashinsky had "repeatedly and brazenly lied" to the 1.7 million customers who trusted him with their savings.5:["slug","alex-mashinsky","d"]
