3:T8f2,Zhimin Qian  -  aka "Yadi Zhang," aka "The Goddess of Wealth"  -  orchestrated a fraud so audacious it reads like rejected fiction. Between 2014 and 2017, she ran a massive investment pyramid through her company Lantian Gerui, defrauding over 128,000 Chinese citizens  -  many of them taxi drivers, butchers, and farmers who invested their life savings. Total take: approximately $6.6 billion.

When Chinese authorities started closing in, Qian didn't book a first-class flight. She fled on a moped to the Myanmar border. From there she moved through Southeast Asia, across Europe, using fake passports, until she settled in London under a fabricated identity.

In London, Qian lived like royalty. She rented a mansion for £17,000 per month. She stayed at the Ritz-Carlton. She bought Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry. And in perhaps the most unhinged detail of the entire saga, she attempted to purchase citizenship in "Liberland"  -  a self-proclaimed micronation on the Serbia-Croatia border  -  with ambitions to become its queen.

Her downfall began when she tried to buy three London properties totaling £40.5 million. The KYC checks flagged her. She couldn't explain where the money came from. British police began their investigation.

In April 2024, the Metropolitan Police arrested Qian and her accomplice Seng Hok Ling. They seized over 61,000 Bitcoin  -  the largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history, worth approximately £5 billion at the time. Officers also found encrypted devices, cash, gold, and additional crypto.

An earlier accomplice, Jian Wen  -  a Chinese takeaway worker Qian had employed as a "butler"  -  was convicted in 2024 and sentenced to six years and eight months for her role in the laundering operation.

In September 2025, Qian pleaded guilty to possession of criminal property and money laundering. In November 2025, she was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months at Southwark Crown Court. Her accomplice Ling received four years and 11 months.

The judge noted that the recovered Bitcoin was "more than enough to repay investors"  -  but that the financial loss was only part of the damage. Over 80 people in China had already received convictions related to the scheme. Thousands of lives were derailed long before the Queen of Liberland got her sentence.5:["slug","zhimin-qian","d"]
