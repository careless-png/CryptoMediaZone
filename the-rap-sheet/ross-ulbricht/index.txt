3:T6e7,Ross Ulbricht was a 26-year-old physics grad from Austin, Texas who decided the best use of his talents was building the Amazon of illegal drugs. In 2011, he launched Silk Road  -  a Tor-hidden marketplace where you could buy anything from weed to fake IDs using Bitcoin. He operated under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts," a reference to The Princess Bride that became the most infamous pseudonym in crypto history.

Silk Road was arguably the first real-world proof that Bitcoin worked as a currency. It processed over $1.2 billion in transactions during its two-year run. Ulbricht took a commission on every sale. The site had a review system, dispute resolution, and customer service. It was disturbingly professional.

The FBI caught him in October 2013 at the San Francisco Public Library. He was chatting as DPR on his laptop when agents distracted him and grabbed the computer before he could encrypt it. The prosecution's case included allegations that Ulbricht had attempted to hire hitmen to kill people who threatened to expose the operation  -  though those charges were never formally brought to trial.

In 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years without parole. The sentence was widely considered extreme, even by people who thought he deserved prison. He became a cause célèbre in libertarian and crypto circles, with a "Free Ross" campaign that lasted a decade.

In January 2025, President Trump pardoned Ulbricht on his first day in office, fulfilling a campaign promise made at a Bitcoin conference. Ulbricht walked free after serving nearly 12 years. The pardon was celebrated across crypto and condemned by law enforcement. Whether you see him as a digital freedom fighter or a drug kingpin depends entirely on who you ask.5:["slug","ross-ulbricht","d"]
