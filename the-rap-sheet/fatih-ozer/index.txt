3:T58b,Fatih Faruk Özer was the 28-year-old CEO of Thodex, Turkey's largest cryptocurrency exchange. In April 2021, with Turkey's economy in crisis and the lira in freefall, millions of Turks had turned to crypto as a hedge. Thodex was their platform of choice.

On April 20, 2021, Thodex suddenly halted all trading, citing a "partnership" deal that required a temporary pause. Then Özer disappeared. He'd already fled to Albania, reportedly carrying a backpack with thousands of dollars in cash. He left behind 391,000 users who couldn't access approximately $2 billion in deposits.

Turkey erupted. This was not abstract crypto wealth  -  it was Turkish citizens' savings during an economic crisis. Police raided Thodex offices and arrested dozens of employees, but Özer was gone. Interpol issued a red notice. Turkish authorities coordinated with Albanian police.

Özer evaded capture for over a year, hiding in Albania under various identities. In August 2022, Albanian police caught him in the coastal city of Vlorë. He was extradited to Turkey to face charges.

In September 2023, a Turkish court sentenced Özer to 11,196 years in prison  -  a symbolic number reflecting the severity of the crime under Turkish law (each victim's charge stacked). It was one of the longest sentences in Turkish legal history. Several Thodex employees also received multi-thousand-year sentences. The funds have not been recovered.5:["slug","fatih-ozer","d"]
