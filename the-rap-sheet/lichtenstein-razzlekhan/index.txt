The trail went cold. For six years, blockchain investigators tracked the stolen funds as they slowly moved through thousands of wallets, mixing services, and chain-hopping maneuvers.

In February 2022, the DOJ announced the largest financial seizure in US history: approximately $3.6 billion in Bitcoin recovered from Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan. The internet immediately lost its mind  -  not because of the amount, but because of Heather Morgan.

Morgan was an aspiring rapper who performed under the name "Razzlekhan" and described herself as the "Crocodile of Wall Street." Her rap videos, Forbes contributor articles, and TikTok content were spectacularly cringe. The contrast between a $3.6 billion crypto heist and a woman rapping badly about being a "bad-ass money maker" became instant internet legend.

But the story had a twist: Lichtenstein eventually admitted he was the actual hacker. He hadn't just laundered the Bitcoin  -  he'd stolen it in the first place. His sophisticated hacking skills were undermined by catastrophically bad operational security. He stored private keys in a cloud account. He kept a spreadsheet of wallets. IRS Criminal Investigation agents followed the trail like breadcrumbs.

Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison. Morgan received 18 months. The sentences were reduced because both cooperated extensively with authorities. The seized Bitcoin, now worth over $10 billion at 2024 prices, became one of the largest asset recoveries in DOJ history.6:["slug","lichtenstein-razzlekhan","d"]
