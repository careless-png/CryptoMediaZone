3:T68f,Dr. Ruja Ignatova is the most successful crypto scammer who ever lived  -  and she's still free. The Bulgarian-German businesswoman created OneCoin in 2014, pitching it as the "Bitcoin killer" to audiences of thousands at stadium-sized events. She wore designer gowns, quoted cryptography papers, and promised investors they were buying the future.

OneCoin had no blockchain. There was no mining. There was no coin. The entire thing was a pyramid scheme wrapped in crypto terminology. Investors bought "educational packages" that came with tokens they could supposedly trade on OneCoin's internal exchange. The exchange was a website with fake numbers. Nothing was real.

By 2017, OneCoin had taken in an estimated $4 billion from victims in over 175 countries. The pitch targeted people in developing nations  -  Uganda, India, Pakistan, Vietnam  -  who had no way to verify the technical claims. Ruja's brother Konstantin helped run the operation while she played the glamorous frontwoman.

On October 25, 2017, Ruja Ignatova boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. She has never been seen again. She was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2022  -  only the 11th woman in history to make the list. There have been rumors of plastic surgery, a luxury yacht in the Mediterranean, and possible murder by organized crime associates. None confirmed.

Her brother Konstantin was arrested and eventually cooperated with US authorities. Co-conspirator Karl Sebastian Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years. But the Cryptoqueen herself remains a ghost. Somewhere in the world, one of history's greatest con artists is living on $4 billion of other people's money.5:["slug","ruja-ignatova","d"]
