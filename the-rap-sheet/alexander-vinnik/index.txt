3:T60c,Alexander Vinnik was a Russian national who operated BTC-e, one of the earliest and shadiest cryptocurrency exchanges. From 2011 to 2017, BTC-e processed an estimated $4 billion in transactions with minimal-to-zero know-your-customer requirements. It was the go-to exchange for ransomware operators, darknet markets, and anyone who needed to clean dirty Bitcoin.

Investigators traced a significant portion of the stolen Mt. Gox Bitcoin through BTC-e. Vinnik was allegedly involved in laundering around 300,000 of the 850,000 BTC stolen from Mt. Gox  -  making him a central figure in the largest crypto heist of the early era.

In July 2017, Vinnik was arrested while vacationing on a beach in northern Greece. What followed was a multi-year international custody battle. The US wanted him for money laundering. Russia wanted him back (likely to prevent him from cooperating with US authorities). France wanted him for laundering ransomware proceeds. Greece was stuck in the middle.

France got him first. In 2020, he was transferred to Paris, tried, and convicted of money laundering. He was sentenced to five years. After serving time in France, the extradition battle continued. In 2024, he was finally extradited to the US where he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Vinnik's story exposed how early crypto exchanges operated as unregulated financial wild wests. BTC-e had no headquarters, no compliance team, and no interest in knowing who its customers were. It was the template for every shady exchange that followed.5:["slug","alexander-vinnik","d"]
