3:T6d6,Changpeng Zhao  -  CZ  -  built Binance into the largest cryptocurrency exchange on Earth. At its peak, Binance handled more trading volume than all its competitors combined. CZ became one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth estimated at $65 billion. He did this by deliberately ignoring anti-money laundering laws.

Binance operated from nowhere and everywhere. It had no official headquarters. It actively avoided regulatory oversight. Internal communications revealed that Binance knowingly served customers in sanctioned countries including Iran, Cuba, and Syria. The exchange processed transactions for Hamas, Al-Qaeda-linked entities, and Russian darknet markets. When compliance officers raised concerns, they were ignored or overruled.

In November 2023, CZ pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and stepped down as Binance CEO. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines  -  the largest corporate penalty in crypto history and one of the largest in US financial history, period.

CZ was sentenced to just four months in federal prison in June 2024. The sentence was controversial  -  prosecutors had asked for three years, and critics pointed out that the punishment was trivially small compared to the scope of violations. CZ served his time at a minimum-security facility and was released in September 2024.

CZ's case is unique on this list because Binance survived. Unlike FTX or Celsius, Binance's customers got their money. The exchange continued to operate under new CEO Richard Teng. CZ stepped back from operations but retained his massive fortune. He arguably got the best deal in crypto criminal history: four months in a low-security facility for years of enabling money laundering on a global scale.5:["slug","cz-zhao","d"]
