3:T42b,In September 2017, Jamie Dimon stood at an investor conference and called Bitcoin "a fraud." He said it was "worse than tulip bulbs" and threatened to fire any JPMorgan trader caught touching it. The quote made global headlines. Bitcoin dipped briefly, then kept climbing.

Within two months, BTC hit $20,000. Within six years, JPMorgan had launched its own blockchain (Onyx), its own token (JPM Coin), and was processing billions in crypto-related transactions. The bank that called Bitcoin a fraud became one of the biggest institutional players in digital assets.

Dimon softened over time but never fully walked it back. By 2024 he was calling Bitcoin "a Ponzi scheme" instead of a fraud, which is technically a downgrade in insults. His bank, meanwhile, offered Bitcoin futures trading, custody services, and blockchain settlement to its wealthiest clients.

The Dimon episode became crypto's favorite example of institutional hypocrisy. The pattern repeated across Wall Street: mock it publicly, build infrastructure for it privately, profit from it eventually.5:["slug","jamie-dimon-fraud","d"]
