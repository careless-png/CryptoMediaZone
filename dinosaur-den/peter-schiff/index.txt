3:T47f,Peter Schiff is a gold bug, podcaster, and the most prolific Bitcoin bear on social media. He has predicted Bitcoin's collapse roughly once a week since 2013. At every price level, from $100 to $126,000, Schiff declared that the top was in and the crash was imminent.

His argument is always the same: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, gold is the only real store of value, and crypto is a speculative bubble that will eventually go to zero. He makes these arguments while selling gold through his company, Euro Pacific Capital, which is a conflict of interest he rarely acknowledges.

The comedy peaked when his son, Spencer Schiff, publicly announced he had moved 100% of his portfolio into Bitcoin. Father and son now argue about monetary theory on social media. The internet loves it.

Schiff's track record is historically terrible. He was bearish at $100, $1,000, $10,000, $50,000, and $100,000. Bitcoin has gone up roughly 80,000% since his first prediction of doom. But Schiff keeps posting, keeps predicting, and keeps being wrong.

He has become crypto's unofficial mascot: the man who is always bearish, always wrong, and always entertaining.5:["slug","peter-schiff","d"]
