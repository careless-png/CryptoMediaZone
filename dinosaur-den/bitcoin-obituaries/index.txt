3:T488,The website 99bitcoins.com has been tracking every time a notable publication or figure declared Bitcoin dead. As of 2025, the count stands at 474 obituaries. The first was written in 2010 when BTC was worth $0.23.

The obituaries follow a pattern. Bitcoin crashes. Media outlets publish articles explaining why this time it really is over. Bitcoin recovers. Nobody retracts their article. Repeat.

Some highlights from the death count: Forbes declared Bitcoin dead in 2012 ($12), 2014 ($350), and 2017 ($4,000). Business Insider killed it in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018. Bloomberg called time of death multiple times before launching a crypto index.

The obituaries peaked in 2017-2018, with 124 death notices in a single year. The second biggest spike was in 2022 after FTX collapsed. Each time, the narrative was the same: this is different from previous crashes, the technology is fundamentally flawed, and the smart money has moved on.

Tracking Bitcoin obituaries has become its own form of entertainment. Every crash produces a fresh wave of hot takes from people who have been wrong about Bitcoin for over a decade.
