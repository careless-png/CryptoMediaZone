3:T50d,If you have ever mentioned Bitcoin to a skeptic, you have heard the tulip comparison. "It's just like Dutch Tulip Mania in the 1630s!" This argument has been deployed at every price point from $1 to $126,000.

The comparison falls apart on contact with basic facts. Tulip Mania lasted roughly three years and was confined to a single country. Bitcoin has been growing for over 16 years across every country on Earth. Tulips are a perishable flower with no utility beyond decoration. Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant digital payment network.

The tulip comparison is also historically lazy. Modern scholars have shown that Tulip Mania was far smaller and less dramatic than the popular myth suggests. Most of the "wild speculation" was in futures contracts that were never settled. The actual economic damage was minimal.

But the comparison persists because it sounds clever and requires no research. It gives the speaker a sense of historical sophistication while revealing they know nothing about either tulips or Bitcoin.

The irony is that the people who compare Bitcoin to tulips in 2017 were proven wrong by 2021. The ones who said it in 2021 were proven wrong by 2024. The comparison has a 100% failure rate over any multi-year time horizon. Tulips, meanwhile, are still about $3 each.5:["slug","tulip-mania-comparison","d"]
