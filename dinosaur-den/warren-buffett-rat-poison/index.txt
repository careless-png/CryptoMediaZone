3:T4c8,At Berkshire Hathaway's 2018 annual meeting, Warren Buffett called Bitcoin "probably rat poison squared." His partner Charlie Munger added that crypto trading was "just dementia." The crowd laughed. Bitcoin didn't care.

Buffett's argument was consistent and simple: Bitcoin produces nothing. No earnings, no dividends, no products. You buy it hoping someone else will pay more later. By Buffett's value investing framework, that makes it pure speculation. He said he wouldn't buy all the Bitcoin in the world for $25.

The problem with Buffett's analysis is that he applies the same logic to gold, which has been a store of value for 5,000 years. He has always been transparent about this blind spot. But the "rat poison squared" quote became the single most-cited piece of Bitcoin FUD in history.

Crypto Twitter adopted it as a badge of honor. "Rat poison squared" merchandise appeared. The joke became that Bitcoin was indeed rat poison, and the rats were the legacy financial system.

Buffett never changed his mind. He is one of the few major Bitcoin critics who remained consistent. No secret crypto investments, no quiet pivots. Just a 93-year-old man who thinks Bitcoin is worthless and says so publicly every year.5:["slug","warren-buffett-rat-poison","d"]
