3:T4f5,In December 2013, Paul Krugman wrote a New York Times column titled "Bitcoin Is Evil." His argument: Bitcoin had no tether to reality, no backing by any government, and was primarily useful for illegal transactions. He called it a bubble driven by libertarian fantasies.

This was not Krugman's first bad technology prediction. In 1998, he wrote that "by 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's." That quote aged so badly it became a meme.

Krugman continued to attack Bitcoin for the next decade. He predicted it would go to zero. He said crypto had "no clear use case." He compared it to the housing bubble. Each prediction was followed by Bitcoin climbing to a new all-time high.

To his credit, Krugman is a legitimate economist who won the Nobel Prize for trade theory. His analysis of traditional economics is respected. But his track record on technology is among the worst of any public intellectual. The fax machine quote and the Bitcoin predictions form a pattern: deep understanding of 20th-century economics, zero intuition for 21st-century technology.

Krugman has quietly stopped writing about Bitcoin as frequently. The Times columns moved on to other topics. Bitcoin did not.5:["slug","paul-krugman","d"]
