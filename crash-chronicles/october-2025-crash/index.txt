ETFs were flowing, digital asset treasuries were accumulating, and the market was pricing in a blowout Q4. The seasonality data backed it up: eight of the last twelve Q4s had been positive for BTC. October was supposed to be the launchpad.

Then October 10 happened. President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, and the crypto market detonated. In 24 hours, $19.37 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated across 1.6 million traders. It was the largest single-day wipeout in crypto history, nine times bigger than the February correction, and dwarfing even the FTX and LUNA collapses.

BTC crashed from $126K to $107K in hours. But the real damage was structural. Around 70,000 BTC worth of open interest evaporated in a single session, wiping out six months of accumulation. Funding rates collapsed. Market depth hollowed out. The system that was supposed to be institutionalized and mature proved it could still break the same way it always had.

On the same day, MSCI published a consultation proposing to reclassify digital asset treasury companies as fund-like vehicles and potentially exclude them from equity indexes. Smart money saw the writing on the wall. The structural bid for BTC from companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) was suddenly in question.

Every bounce since has been driven by short covering, not new demand. Spot volumes have been cut in half. ETF flows flipped negative. Bitcoin has underperformed the Nasdaq by over 25% since the crash. Altcoins got destroyed even worse, with some Layer-2 tokens dropping 70%.

As of early 2026, the bleeding has accelerated. BTC broke below $70,000 in February, briefly touching $60,000 before bouncing to the mid-60s. That puts Bitcoin down over 47% from its peak. Institutional ETF buyers who powered the 2024 rally have flipped to net sellers. CryptoQuant declared a bear market. Analysts compare it to the 2018 and 2022 drawdowns. Some see $50,000 or even $40,000 as realistic targets. The four-year cycle crowd says this is textbook. The supercycle crowd has gone quiet. The market is waiting for a catalyst that has not arrived.6:["slug","october-2025-crash","d"]
