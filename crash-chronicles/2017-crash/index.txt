3:T694,2017 was the year crypto went fully mainstream. Bitcoin went from $1,000 in January to nearly $20,000 in December. Everyone was a genius. Uber drivers gave crypto tips. Dentists launched ICOs. The phrase "to the moon" entered the global vocabulary.

The ICO craze was the centerpiece. Initial Coin Offerings let anyone raise millions by publishing a whitepaper and selling tokens. Over $20 billion was raised through ICOs in 2017-2018. Most of the projects were vaporware. Some were outright scams. But the money kept flowing because the prices kept going up, and the prices kept going up because the money kept flowing.

When the music stopped, it stopped hard. Bitcoin peaked on December 17, 2017, just short of $20,000. By February 2018, it had lost half its value. By December 2018, it was sitting at $3,200. An 84% crash that wiped out anyone who had bought in during the mania.

The altcoin carnage was even worse. Coins that had gone up 50x came back down 99%. EOS, which raised $4.1 billion in its ICO, became a ghost chain. Dozens of projects that had raised hundreds of millions simply disappeared. Their founders cashed out and vanished.

The 2017 crash was different from earlier ones because it wasn't triggered by a single event. It was the natural deflation of a speculative bubble. There was no hack. No exchange collapse. Just the slow realization that most of these tokens were worthless and always had been.

The crypto winter lasted until early 2020. Three years of declining prices, shrinking communities, and a general sense that maybe this time it really was over. Then COVID hit, stimulus checks arrived, DeFi summer ignited, and the whole cycle started again.5:["slug","2017-crash","d"]
