3:T6d3,March 12, 2020. Black Thursday. The day COVID-19 broke the global financial system and took crypto down with it.

As the World Health Organization declared a pandemic and countries started locking down, every asset class on earth sold off simultaneously. Stocks, bonds, gold, oil, and yes, Bitcoin. Investors sold everything for cash. The S&P 500 dropped 10% in a single day. Bitcoin dropped from $10,000 to $3,800 in 24 hours. A 62% crash, most of it happening in a single afternoon.

The crypto-specific damage was amplified by the leverage wipeout. BitMEX, the dominant derivatives exchange, saw $1.6 billion in liquidations. Traders running 50x and 100x leverage got annihilated. The exchange actually went down under the load, which some argued saved the market from a total collapse by halting the cascade.

For about 48 hours, it felt like the end. Not just for crypto, but for everything. Markets were in full panic mode. Central banks scrambled to inject liquidity. Governments announced emergency stimulus packages.

Then the recovery happened. And it happened fast. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and began pumping trillions of dollars into the economy. Stimulus checks landed in bank accounts. Interest rates on savings went to nothing. Suddenly, a digital asset that couldn't be printed by any government looked very attractive.

Bitcoin recovered to $10,000 within two months. By December 2020, it was at $29,000. By April 2021, it was at $64,000. The fastest and most dramatic recovery in crypto history, fueled by the same money printing that caused the crash in the first place.

COVID didn't kill crypto. It gave crypto the narrative it had been waiting for: "what happens when governments print unlimited money?"5:["slug","2020-crash","d"]
