3:Ta6e,Bitcoin hit $126,080 in early October 2025. A new all-time high. ETFs were buying hand over fist. Digital asset treasury companies like MicroStrategy were leveraging their balance sheets to stack more BTC. Altcoin ETFs were getting approved left and right. The narrative was simple: institutions are here, the floor is in, the only way is up.

Then October 10th happened.

President Trump announced 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, plus new export controls on critical software. Global markets tanked. Tech stocks had their worst single day since April. But crypto took the real hit. BTC dropped from $122,500 to $107,000 in hours. Across the market, $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in 48 hours. It was the largest single liquidation event in the history of cryptocurrency. Not 2022. Not the COVID crash. October 10th, 2025.

But the crash itself wasn't the story. The story was what happened next: nothing. The bounce never came.

On the same day as the tariff announcement, MSCI quietly published a consultation document proposing to exclude digital asset treasury companies from their indexes. JPMorgan estimated this could trigger $8.8 billion in forced passive outflows. Pension funds, index trackers, and institutional vehicles that had been buying BTC exposure through stocks like MSTR would be forced to sell. The very structures that powered the 2024-2025 rally were being pulled out from underneath it.

By November, Bitcoin was at $86,000 and the total crypto market cap had dropped below $3 trillion for the first time in months. Fear and Greed Index sat at "Extreme Fear." ETF outflows accelerated. The same institutional buyers everyone had counted on became institutional sellers.

The selling didn't stop. BTC ground lower through December and January. In early February 2026, it briefly crashed below $61,000 before bouncing back to the $66,000-$70,000 range. At time of writing, Bitcoin sits around $68,000, down 47% from its October peak and still falling.

Analysts at CryptoQuant declared the bear market official, noting that Bitcoin's demand growth had "decisively slowed." The four-year halving cycle, which many thought was dead, appears to be alive and well. Bitcoin peaked in the fourth quarter of the halving year, just like it did in 2013, 2017, and 2021. The pattern held. The people who said "this time is different" were wrong again.

The 2025 crash taught a brutal lesson: institutions don't prevent bear markets. They participate in them. When the same ETFs that drove prices up become net sellers, the leverage and liquidity they brought amplifies the crash. The floor everyone believed in wasn't a floor at all.5:["slug","2025-crash","d"]
