3:T5e6,Bitcoin was barely two years old when it had its first full-blown crash. In June 2011, BTC rocketed from $1 to $32 in a matter of weeks. Then it fell off a cliff.

The trigger was the Mt. Gox hack. When the exchange went offline and BTC briefly traded at $0.01 on its platform, confidence shattered. Sellers flooded the market. Within months, Bitcoin had lost 94% of its value, falling from $32 all the way down to $2.

To understand how this felt, you have to remember the context. Bitcoin in 2011 had no institutional investors. No ETFs. No mainstream media coverage except the occasional "weird internet money" story. The entire community was a handful of cypherpunks, libertarians, and tech nerds trading on a single exchange run by a guy who originally built the site for Magic: The Gathering cards.

When the price hit $32, it felt like a life-changing moment. People who had been mining BTC on their laptops suddenly had real money. When it crashed to $2, many of those same people sold everything and walked away, convinced the experiment was over.

They were wrong. It would take two years, but Bitcoin clawed back. By November 2013, it had blown past its old high and was trading above $1,000.

The 2011 crash established a pattern that would repeat over and over: speculative mania, a catalyst that breaks confidence, a brutal drawdown, and then a slow, grinding recovery that eventually reaches new highs. Every crash since has followed the same script. The only things that change are the numbers.5:["slug","2011-crash","d"]
