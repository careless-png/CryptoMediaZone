3:T632,The 2013 bull run was the first time Bitcoin entered the mainstream. BTC went from $13 in January to $1,100 by December. Regular people started paying attention. TV news mentioned it. Your uncle asked about it at Thanksgiving.

Then it all fell apart. The crash came from two directions at once. Mt. Gox, still the dominant exchange, was showing signs of stress. Withdrawals were slow. Rumors circulated about insolvency. Users couldn't get their money out.

At the same time, China's central bank declared that financial institutions could not handle Bitcoin transactions. The Chinese market, which had been a huge driver of the rally, pulled back overnight. The combination of exchange problems and regulatory shock sent the price into a nosedive.

BTC dropped from $1,100 to $170 over the next year. An 85% drawdown that took three full years to recover from. During that time, the crypto community shrank dramatically. Projects folded. Developers moved on. The subreddit was full of people posting screenshots of their losses and asking whether they should sell.

The 2013 crash taught the industry two hard lessons. First, relying on a single exchange is suicidal for the ecosystem. When Mt. Gox sneezes, everyone catches pneumonia. Second, government action in China can move markets overnight. Both of these lessons would be learned again, multiple times, in the years that followed.

The people who held through the entire three-year winter were rewarded beyond their wildest expectations. The 2017 bull run would take BTC to $20,000, a return of over 100x from the 2013 bottom.5:["slug","2013-crash","d"]
