The platform let anyone create and launch a token in under 60 seconds with no coding required. Just pick a name, upload an image, set supply, and deploy. The barrier to creating a cryptocurrency dropped to zero.

The result was an explosion. Over 6 million tokens were created on the platform within its first year. Most died within hours. A tiny fraction gained enough traction to migrate to decentralized exchanges. An even tinier fraction made early buyers rich.

The economics were brilliantly simple. Each token launched with a bonding curve: early buyers got cheap prices, and each subsequent purchase pushed the price higher. When the bonding curve filled, the token graduated to a DEX with real liquidity. It was a built-in mechanism for price discovery and hype generation.

Pump.fun generated over $500 million in protocol revenue, making it one of the most profitable crypto applications ever built. The platform did not create tokens. It created a casino with infinite slot machines, and people could not stop pulling the lever.

The dark side was predictable. Most tokens were rug pulls, scams, or jokes that lasted minutes. Celebrity tokens launched and crashed. Offensive tokens proliferated. Pump.fun had to implement content moderation, an ironic development for a crypto platform.

But the platform proved something fundamental about crypto markets: the demand for speculation is bottomless. Given the tools to gamble on anything, people will gamble on everything. Pump.fun just made the gambling faster.6:["slug","bnb-memecoins","d"]
