It was the first time in history that a sitting (or incoming) U.S. president directly launched a cryptocurrency.

The token surged to a $15 billion market cap within 48 hours. The hype was unprecedented. Supporters treated it as a political statement. Traders treated it as the ultimate meme coin play. The Solana network strained under the transaction volume.

Then the details emerged. Roughly 80% of the token supply was held by Trump-affiliated entities. The insider allocation was staggering. Critics called it an unprecedented conflict of interest: a president financially benefiting from crypto speculation while simultaneously setting crypto policy.

Melania Trump launched her own $MELANIA token the following day, which immediately cannibalized demand from $TRUMP. Both tokens experienced extreme volatility, with early buyers making fortunes and latecomers getting crushed.

The $TRUMP coin crystallized every tension in crypto. Decentralization vs. political power. Community tokens vs. insider enrichment. Innovation vs. grift. It was the most politically charged moment in crypto history.

Regardless of where you stand politically, $TRUMP proved something important: meme coins are now a geopolitical phenomenon. When a U.S. president launches a token, the industry has reached a level of mainstream penetration that nobody predicted five years ago.6:["slug","trump-coin","d"]
