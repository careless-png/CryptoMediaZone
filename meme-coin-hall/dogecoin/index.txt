3:T5d8,Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin in approximately two hours on December 6, 2013. It was a joke. The code was forked from Litecoin, the logo was the Shiba Inu "Doge" meme, and the total supply was set to infinity. Nothing about it was meant to be serious.

For years, it stayed a joke. Dogecoin's main use case was tipping people on Reddit. The community was wholesome. They sponsored a NASCAR car. They funded the Jamaican bobsled team for the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was funny and harmless.

Then Elon Musk discovered it. Starting in 2019, Musk began posting Dogecoin memes. Each tweet moved the price. By early 2021, his influence was rocket fuel. When Musk went on Saturday Night Live in May 2021 and called DOGE "a hustle," the price crashed 30% on live television. But the community held.

Dogecoin peaked at $0.74 on May 8, 2021, giving it a market cap of $88 billion. A coin created as a joke in two hours was briefly worth more than Ford Motor Company. The absurdity of it was the point.

The price has since declined over 85% from peak, but Dogecoin remains the most recognized meme coin in existence. It proved a strange truth about markets: in a world where attention is the scarcest resource, a meme can be more valuable than a technology.

Markus sold all his DOGE in 2015 to buy a used Honda Civic. Palmer left crypto entirely, calling the industry a scam controlled by wealthy insiders. The creators of the world's most famous meme coin want nothing to do with it.5:["slug","dogecoin","d"]
