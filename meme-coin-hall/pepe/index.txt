3:T582,PEPE launched in April 2023, during one of the most depressing periods in crypto. The market was still recovering from FTX. Volumes were dead. Sentiment was in the gutter. Nobody expected a meme coin to rip.

PEPE ripped anyway. In its first three weeks, the token went from zero to a $1.6 billion market cap. Early buyers who put in $250 made over $1 million. The returns were so absurd that they briefly made crypto fun again in the middle of a bear market.

There was no utility. No roadmap. No team promises. Just a Pepe the Frog meme and a smart contract on Ethereum. The honesty was refreshing. PEPE did not pretend to be a technology company or a DeFi protocol. It was a meme coin and it said so.

PEPE kicked off the 2023-2024 meme coin renaissance. It proved that the meme coin playbook (community + virality + low entry price) still worked even without a bull market. Solana's meme coin ecosystem (BONK, WIF, BOME) followed in PEPE's footsteps.

By 2024, PEPE's market cap had exceeded $7 billion during the Bitcoin ETF rally. A frog drawing was worth more than most publicly traded companies. The token created a new generation of meme coin traders who abandoned "fundamentals" entirely in favor of "vibes."

Whether this is innovation or insanity depends on your perspective. But PEPE undeniably proved that meme coins are not going away. They are crypto's native form of speculative entertainment.5:["slug","pepe","d"]
