3:T57a,Wormhole was one of the biggest bridges connecting Solana to Ethereum. On February 2, 2022, someone found a bug in its signature verification system and used it to mint 120,000 wETH out of thin air. That's $326 million in Ethereum, created from nothing.

The vulnerability was in how Wormhole verified guardian signatures on the Solana side. The attacker figured out a way to bypass the verification process entirely, tricking the bridge into believing a legitimate set of guardians had approved a massive deposit that never happened. They then redeemed the fake deposit on the Ethereum side for real ETH.

The attacker moved fast. Within hours of the exploit, they had swapped a chunk of the stolen wETH for regular ETH on the Ethereum mainnet, making it much harder to freeze.

Here's where money talks. Jump Crypto, a major trading firm and investor in Wormhole, stepped in and replaced the entire $326 million. They just covered the loss out of their own pocket to keep the bridge solvent. No lengthy bankruptcy proceedings. No decade of creditor lawsuits. Just a massive check from a deep-pocketed backer.

The speed of Jump's bailout raised eyebrows. Some saw it as a sign that DeFi had responsible actors willing to backstop the ecosystem. Others saw it as proof that DeFi was just TradFi wearing a hoodie, where the big players protect their investments while regular users cross their fingers.5:["slug","wormhole","d"]
