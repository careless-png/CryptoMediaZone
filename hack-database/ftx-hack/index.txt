3:T5bc,FTX was already dead when someone decided to rob the corpse. On November 11, 2022, the same night FTX filed for bankruptcy, roughly $477 million in crypto was drained from the exchange's wallets.

Users watching on-chain saw the funds moving in real time and posted frantic warnings on social media. FTX's general counsel told employees the company had been "hacked" and to delete their apps. The new CEO, restructuring expert John Ray III, confirmed unauthorized access to the wallets. It was chaos on top of chaos.

The timing was suspicious from the start. FTX was collapsing. Sam Bankman-Fried had just been ousted. The company was transitioning to new management. Security protocols were in shambles. Someone used that window of confusion to grab nearly half a billion dollars.

For months, the identity of the hacker was unknown. Theories ranged from a rogue insider to SBF himself to external attackers exploiting the chaos. Then in late 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted three individuals connected to a SIM-swapping gang. Authorities alleged they'd exploited a known vulnerability in FTX's infrastructure during the bankruptcy chaos.

The stolen funds were partially traced through a series of on-chain swaps and bridge transfers. Some was converted to Bitcoin, some moved through decentralized exchanges. The investigation is still ongoing, but the hack proved one thing beyond any doubt: when an exchange falls apart, everything is up for grabs.5:["slug","ftx-hack","d"]
