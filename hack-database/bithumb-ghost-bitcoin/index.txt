3:T17b7,This is, without exaggeration, the most absurd thing that has ever happened on a cryptocurrency exchange. And in an industry that includes a man who faked his own death to steal $190 million and a dog-themed token worth $88 billion, that is saying something.

On the evening of February 6, 2026, someone at Bithumb  -  South Korea's second-largest crypto exchange  -  sat down to run a promotional event called "Random Treasure Chest." Simple enough. Give 695 lucky users a small cash reward. Between 2,000 and 50,000 Korean won each. That's $1.40 to $34. Pocket change. A marketing gimmick. The kind of thing every exchange does to keep users engaged.

The employee opened the distribution system. Typed in the amounts. Hit send. And accidentally created $44 billion out of thin air.

The mistake was almost comically simple. Where the field said currency unit, the employee typed "BTC" instead of "KRW." Three letters. One dropdown menu. That's all it took. Instead of receiving 2,000 Korean won, each winner received 2,000 Bitcoin. Instead of distributing a total of 620,000 Korean won  -  about $423  -  the system distributed 620,000 Bitcoin. At the market price of $66,000 per coin, that came to $40.9 billion. Nearly three percent of Bitcoin's entire maximum supply of 21 million coins. Fifteen times more Bitcoin than Bithumb actually held in its vaults.

The Bitcoin didn't exist. Not on the blockchain. Not in Bithumb's reserves. Not anywhere in reality. They were ghost coins  -  entries on Bithumb's internal ledger that had no backing whatsoever. The exchange's internal system simply credited the accounts, no questions asked. No secondary verification. No "are you sure you want to send $44 billion?" prompt. Nothing.

But ghost or not, the numbers showed up in people's accounts. And 249 of the 695 winners opened their treasure chests before anyone noticed.

What would you do if you woke up and found 2,000 Bitcoin in your exchange account? Some people froze. Some people panicked. And some people did the most human thing imaginable: they hit sell.

By 19:20 Korean time, Bithumb realized what had happened. Users were already dumping. Bitcoin on Bithumb's BTC/KRW pair plunged 17%, briefly touching 81 million won  -  roughly $55,000  -  while the global price held steady above $66,000. For a few surreal minutes, there were two Bitcoin prices: the real one, and the Bithumb one, which was being hammered by people selling coins that didn't actually exist.

At 19:35, Bithumb pulled the emergency brake. Trading frozen. Withdrawals frozen. All 695 affected accounts locked. At 19:40, the recovery operation began. By the time the dust settled, 1,788 BTC had been sold before the freeze. Real money had changed hands for fake Bitcoin.

Bithumb's internal "abnormal transaction control system" clawed back 618,212 BTC out of the 620,000  -  a 99.7% recovery rate. Of the 1,788 BTC that users sold, 93% of the corresponding value was recovered. The exchange covered the rest from its own reserves. About 125 Bitcoin in value remained unaccounted for. A rounding error in the context of $44 billion, but a rounding error that somebody, somewhere, got to keep.

The real scandal wasn't the typo. Typos happen. The scandal was that Bithumb's system allowed it to happen at all. There was no multi-level approval for distributing crypto. No sanity check on the amount. No flag when an employee tried to send out fifteen times the exchange's entire Bitcoin reserves. Nothing between a finger slip and forty-four billion dollars in phantom assets.

Hwang Seung-wook, Bithumb's Vice President of Exchange Business, sent an internal email that leaked almost immediately. "The fact that a single error in setting an event reward unit can destabilize an entire crypto exchange demonstrates the current state of our systems," he wrote. He promised to fix the oversight failures rather than blame individuals. The subtext was clear: the individual made a mistake, but the system let the mistake become a catastrophe.

South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service didn't wait for an invitation. FSS Governor Lee Chan-jin held an emergency press conference and delivered the line that will define this incident forever: "It was nothing more than erroneously entered virtual data, yet it ended up being traded. That is the essence of the issue: the transaction was actually executed."

Ghost Bitcoin. Traded on a real exchange. For real money. By real people. And nobody's system said stop.

Regulators launched on-site inspections at Bithumb's offices on February 7. They demanded a list of every employee authorized to issue crypto payments. The Financial Services Commission convened emergency meetings. DAXA, the alliance of Korean crypto exchanges, announced internal control reviews across all member platforms. New legislation is now being drafted requiring exchanges to implement controls equivalent to those at traditional banks.

The timing was brutal. South Korea had just lifted a nine-year ban on companies investing in crypto. Spot ETFs were on the horizon. KRW-pegged stablecoins were being planned. The entire country was in the middle of legitimizing crypto, and its second-largest exchange just proved you could accidentally create $44 billion with a dropdown menu.

Bithumb did the right things after. They compensated users who sold at the crashed price  -  full sale amount plus 10%. Seven days of fee-free trading. 20,000 won ($15) to every active user on the platform. A 100 billion won ($68 million) protection fund. All the right crisis management moves.

But the question that keeps the regulators up at night isn't about Bithumb's response. It's about what this revealed. If Bithumb could create 620,000 ghost Bitcoins on its internal ledger  -  coins that were then traded, sold, and partially converted to real money  -  then what's the actual relationship between the numbers on your exchange account and the coins that exist on the blockchain?

The answer, as it turns out, is: it depends on whether someone typed the right three letters.5:["slug","bithumb-ghost-bitcoin","d"]
