3:T594,This wasn't a hack. It was a slow-motion robbery that lasted three years. By the time anyone noticed, 850,000 BTC had vanished from the world's largest exchange.

Mark Karpeles discovered the loss in early 2014. The Bitcoin had been quietly drained from Mt. Gox wallets since 2011, likely through a transaction malleability exploit that let attackers make withdrawals look like they'd failed, then request the same funds again. Over and over and over.

On February 7, Mt. Gox halted all withdrawals. On February 24, the website went blank. Customers stared at a white page where their life savings used to be. By February 28, Karpeles filed for bankruptcy.

Then the saga got weird. While sorting through the wreckage, Karpeles found 200,000 BTC sitting in an old wallet that everyone had forgotten about. A $116 million surprise buried in a digital filing cabinet.

The aftermath dragged on for a decade. Creditors organized. Lawyers got rich. Karpeles got arrested in Japan, spent 11 months in detention, and was acquitted of embezzlement but convicted of data manipulation. The Japanese police interrogated him for 50 straight days without a break.

The final twist is the cruelest part. If Mt. Gox had simply held that Bitcoin, the remaining stash would have been worth more than all the claims combined. Some creditors who waited ten years actually turned a profit. The slowest, most painful investment strategy in history.5:["slug","mt-gox-2014","d"]
