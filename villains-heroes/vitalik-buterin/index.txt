3:T71e,Vitalik Buterin was 17 when he started writing about Bitcoin for a blog that paid him 5 BTC per article. At 19, he published the Ethereum whitepaper. By 21, Ethereum was live, and he'd created the foundation for an entirely new category of technology: smart contracts.

Before Ethereum, blockchain could only do one thing: move tokens from wallet A to wallet B. Vitalik's insight was that you could put programmable logic on the blockchain. If-then statements. Loops. Contracts that execute themselves. This simple idea spawned DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and an entire ecosystem worth hundreds of billions.

What makes Vitalik unusual isn't just the technical achievement. It's how he carries it. He lives simply. He wears the same t-shirts. He writes dense research posts about Ethereum scaling that somehow manage to be readable. He pushes back against the culture of speculation and greed that dominates crypto.

The most famous example came in May 2021. The creators of Shiba Inu, a meme coin, sent 50% of their entire token supply to Vitalik's wallet as a marketing stunt, assuming he'd never do anything with it. He donated $1 billion worth to India's COVID relief fund, then burned the rest. The move was part generosity, part statement: don't drag me into your pump schemes.

He's not without critics. The DAO fork was controversial. Ethereum's pivot from proof of work to proof of stake angered miners. Some accuse the Ethereum Foundation of having too much centralized influence. But Vitalik has consistently pushed toward decentralization, even when it meant slower progress.

He's still writing blog posts. Still showing up at conferences in his rainbow cat shirts. Still the most recognizable figure in an industry full of people trying to get rich, standing out because he seems genuinely more interested in building.5:["slug","vitalik-buterin","d"]
