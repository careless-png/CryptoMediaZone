Binance launched in July 2017 and by December it was processing more trades than any competitor. By 2022, it handled roughly 60% of all global crypto spot trading volume. The platform that CZ built became the backbone of the entire crypto market.

He did it by being faster, cheaper, and more aggressive than everyone else. While competitors navigated regulatory frameworks and compliance departments, CZ operated Binance from nowhere and everywhere. No headquarters. No fixed jurisdiction. Servers scattered across the globe. The exchange was registered in the Cayman Islands, then Malta, then nowhere in particular. Regulators in dozens of countries issued warnings. CZ kept building.

The strategy worked spectacularly until it didn't. In November 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a landmark settlement. Binance would pay $4.3 billion in fines, the largest penalty ever imposed on a financial institution for anti-money laundering violations. CZ personally pleaded guilty to one count of failing to maintain an effective AML program and agreed to step down as CEO.

The charges revealed that Binance had knowingly processed transactions for sanctioned entities, terrorist financing organizations, and ransomware operators. Internal communications showed employees discussing how to help users in sanctioned countries bypass restrictions. CZ had been warned by compliance staff and chose growth over compliance.

But here is where the story gets complicated. CZ didn't steal customer funds. He didn't run a Ponzi scheme. Binance's reserves were real. When FTX collapsed and the entire industry was scrambling, Binance was the one still standing. When customers panic-withdrew billions, Binance processed every single withdrawal. The exchange that regulators wanted to shut down was the one that actually worked.

CZ served four months in a federal facility and was released in September 2024. He has not returned to run Binance. Richard Teng took over as CEO. But CZ's wealth, estimated at over $30 billion, makes him one of the richest people in crypto. He has shifted focus to education, investment, and blockchain infrastructure projects.

The crypto community remains deeply split on CZ. To some, he is the man who gave millions of people access to crypto markets when traditional exchanges wouldn't. He listed tokens others wouldn't touch. He provided leverage and derivatives when regulators were trying to block retail access. He called out FTX's fraud with a single tweet that triggered the run that exposed SBF.

To others, he ran a compliance-free zone that laundered money for criminals and terrorists, ignored every rule that traditional finance follows, and only cooperated with authorities when the alternative was prison.

The truth is probably both. CZ built something genuinely useful and genuinely reckless at the same time. Binance survived regulatory nuclear war and came out the other side still processing more volume than anyone. Whether that makes CZ a visionary or a cautionary tale depends entirely on which part of the story you focus on.6:["slug","changpeng-zhao","d"]
