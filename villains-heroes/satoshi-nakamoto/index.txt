3:T756,On October 31, 2008, someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto posted a paper to a cryptography mailing list. The title was boring: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The paper was nine pages. It described a system for digital money that didn't need banks, governments, or any trusted middleman. It used cryptographic proof instead of trust.

On January 3, 2009, Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block. Embedded in it was a message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." A timestamp and a statement of purpose, all in one line.

For the next two years, Satoshi worked on Bitcoin openly. They posted on forums, emailed developers, and refined the code. Their writing was precise, formal, and used British spellings. They never revealed a single personal detail. No age, no nationality, no photo. Nothing.

In April 2011, Satoshi sent a final email to developer Mike Hearn saying they had "moved on to other things." Then they vanished. Completely. No goodbye post. No interview. No cashing out. The roughly one million BTC they mined in the early days has never moved. Not a single satoshi.

That stack is now worth over $100 billion. It sits in wallets that anyone can see on the blockchain but nobody can access. A digital monument to the greatest disappearing act in the history of technology.

Theories about Satoshi's identity range from plausible to absurd. Nick Szabo, a computer scientist who designed a precursor to Bitcoin called "bit gold," is a frequent candidate. Hal Finney, who received the first Bitcoin transaction, is another. Some think it was a group. Craig Wright claims it was him, but courts have ruled he was lying.

The beauty of the mystery is that it doesn't matter. Bitcoin works whether Satoshi is alive or dead, one person or ten. The code speaks for itself. And maybe that was the point all along.5:["slug","satoshi-nakamoto","d"]
