3:T6f0,Hal Finney was a cryptographer, cypherpunk, and the first person other than Satoshi Nakamoto to run Bitcoin. On January 12, 2009, he received 10 BTC from Satoshi in what was the very first Bitcoin transaction between two people.

Finney wasn't a casual participant. He was one of the first people to respond to Satoshi's initial announcement on the cryptography mailing list. While most of the list ignored or dismissed the idea, Finney jumped in. He ran the software, found bugs, and sent feedback. His excitement was genuine. His famous tweet from January 10, 2009 simply said: "Running bitcoin."

Before Bitcoin, Finney had already built an impressive career in cryptography. He was one of the early employees at PGP Corporation, working on Pretty Good Privacy, the encryption software that became the standard for email security. He also created the first reusable proof-of-work system, a concept that directly inspired elements of Bitcoin's design.

Finney was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) in August 2009, just months after Bitcoin launched. Despite his deteriorating condition, he continued to contribute to Bitcoin development, writing code even as his physical abilities faded. He typed with a single finger, then with eye-tracking software, then not at all.

He passed away on August 28, 2014. His body was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, making him one of the very few people in history to be preserved in this way.

Some people believe Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto. The timeline fits. The expertise fits. The proximity fits. But there's no conclusive evidence either way, and Finney himself always denied it. Whether he was Satoshi or simply Satoshi's most dedicated early collaborator, his contribution to Bitcoin is immeasurable.5:["slug","hal-finney","d"]
