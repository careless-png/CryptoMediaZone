3:T5f3,Do Kwon was the loudest man in crypto. He mocked critics on Twitter, called skeptics "poor," and bet his entire reputation on an algorithmic stablecoin called UST that he said was mathematically impossible to fail.

UST was designed to hold its $1 peg through a balancing mechanism with LUNA. When UST demand fell, LUNA would be burned. When UST demand rose, LUNA would be minted. It was elegant on paper. In practice, it was a time bomb with a countdown nobody could see.

In May 2022, a large sell-off of UST broke the peg. The algorithmic mechanism kicked in and started minting LUNA to restore it. But the more LUNA was minted, the lower its price fell. The lower LUNA fell, the more had to be minted. A death spiral. In 72 hours, LUNA went from $80 to fractions of a cent. $40 billion in market value turned to zero.

People lost everything. Retirement savings. College funds. At least a handful of suicides were linked to the collapse. Crypto Twitter became a rolling wave of grief, rage, and disbelief.

Kwon initially showed zero remorse. He tweeted about building a "LUNA 2.0" days after people lost their life savings. When Interpol issued a red notice, he fled South Korea. He was eventually caught in Montenegro in March 2023, carrying fake Costa Rican passports.

After a tangled extradition fight between South Korea and the U.S., Kwon was convicted of fraud and market manipulation. His arrogance didn't help him in court. The man who told critics to "have fun staying poor" found out exactly how that feels.5:["slug","do-kwon","d"]
