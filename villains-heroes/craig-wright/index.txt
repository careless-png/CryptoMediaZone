3:T6f7,Craig Wright is an Australian computer scientist who has spent nearly a decade claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. In 2024, a UK court conclusively ruled that he is not Satoshi and never was.

Wright first appeared on the scene in 2015 when Wired and Gizmodo published investigations suggesting he might be Satoshi. He met privately with Bitcoin core developers and showed them what he claimed was a cryptographic signature proving his identity. But when asked to provide the same proof publicly, he refused.

Over the next several years, Wright filed hundreds of lawsuits against developers, researchers, and anyone who publicly denied his claims. He sued the Bitcoin core development team. He sued podcasters. He sued open source developers. The legal campaign was so aggressive that it became a form of intimidation, forcing people to spend time and money defending themselves in court.

The whole thing came to a head in 2024 when the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) brought a case to establish once and for all whether Wright was Satoshi. After weeks of testimony and a mountain of evidence, Justice Mellor ruled that Wright had engaged in "extensive and deliberate" forgery. Documents he'd presented as proof had been backdated. Metadata didn't match. Fonts that didn't exist in 2008 appeared in documents supposedly written in 2008.

The court didn't just say Wright wasn't Satoshi. It said he'd forged evidence on a "grand scale" to support his claim.

Wright never moved a single bitcoin from the Satoshi wallets. He never produced a valid cryptographic signature. The simplest proof in all of crypto, signing a message with Satoshi's private key, was something he could never do. Because he doesn't have the keys. Because he's not Satoshi.5:["slug","craig-wright","d"]
