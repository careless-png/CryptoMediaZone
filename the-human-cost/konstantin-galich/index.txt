3:T614,Konstantin Galich, known online as Kostya Kudo, was a 32-year-old Ukrainian cryptocurrency trader who managed approximately $65 million in client funds, reportedly including money from Ukrainian military intelligence officials. On October 11, 2025  -  one day after the devastating crypto market crash  -  he was found dead in his Lamborghini Urus in Kyiv with a gunshot wound to the head.

Galich had sent farewell messages to associates before his death. The gun found in the vehicle was reportedly a personal gift from the head of Ukraine's military intelligence service, a detail that added layers of intrigue and speculation to the case.

Ukrainian authorities initially treated the death as a suicide, but the circumstances generated significant debate. Galich had lost a substantial portion of client funds in the October 10 crash. The combination of massive financial losses, obligations to powerful clients, and the violent context of wartime Ukraine created pressure that few people could comprehend from the outside.

Whether Galich took his own life or was killed by someone to whom he owed money has not been definitively established. What is clear is that a 32-year-old man is dead, and that the October 2025 crash  -  like LUNA before it  -  did not just destroy portfolios. It destroyed lives.
