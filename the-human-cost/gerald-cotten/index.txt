3:T6ce,Gerald Cotten was the 30-year-old CEO of QuadrigaCX, Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange. In December 2018, while on honeymoon in India, he reportedly died of complications from Crohn's disease. He was the sole person with access to the exchange's cold wallets containing approximately $190 million in customer cryptocurrency.

His death set off one of the most bizarre sagas in crypto history. 115,000 customers were locked out of their funds. An investigation revealed that Cotten had been running a Ponzi-like operation  -  trading with customer funds, creating fake accounts, and losing money on bad trades. Much of the $190 million may not have existed in the wallets at all.

The crypto community was split between those who believed Cotten was dead and those who suspected he had faked his death to escape with the money. The death certificate was issued in India under circumstances that raised questions. Conspiracy theories flourished. Netflix made a documentary. In 2023, lawyers formally requested his body be exhumed to confirm his identity.

For the 115,000 victims, the truth barely mattered. Their money was gone regardless. Creditors eventually received roughly 13 cents on the dollar. Cotten's widow returned assets voluntarily but insisted she had no knowledge of the fraud.

Two small dogs that Cotten and his wife had adopted received a $100,000 trust fund in his will. The 115,000 customers who lost their savings received nothing close to that level of consideration.
