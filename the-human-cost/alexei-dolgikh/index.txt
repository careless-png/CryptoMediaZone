3:T563,In November 2025, Alexei Dolgikh, a Russian cryptocurrency millionaire, was killed when his Lamborghini Urus crashed at high speed in Moscow. The vehicle struck a barrier, overturned, and caught fire. Two of the four passengers died, including Dolgikh.

The circumstances surrounding the crash were never fully clarified. Moscow's high-speed driving culture, combined with the lifestyle associated with young crypto wealth in Russia, created conditions where such tragedies were almost inevitable. The crash may have been a simple accident. It may have been something else.

Dolgikh's death occurred during a broader pattern of crypto-related deaths among Russian entrepreneurs, adding to speculation about whether some of these incidents were truly accidental. However, no evidence of foul play was publicly established in his case.

The intersection of extreme wealth, high-performance vehicles, and the reckless invincibility that sometimes accompanies sudden crypto fortunes has become its own category of risk. Multiple crypto millionaires have died in car crashes, often in vehicles that represent their newly acquired status.
