3:T5fb,In January 2025, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger  -  the hardware wallet company that protects billions of dollars in cryptocurrency  -  was kidnapped along with his wife from their home in France. The attackers severed one of Balland's fingers and sent video of the mutilation to Ledger executives, demanding €10 million in ransom.

French special forces (GIGN) tracked the kidnappers and rescued both Balland and his wife after approximately 48 hours. Multiple suspects were arrested. Balland survived but the psychological and physical trauma of the ordeal was severe.

The attack was notable for its brutality and its target. Balland was not just a crypto holder  -  he was the co-founder of the company that makes the devices people use to protect their crypto. The symbolism was not lost on the industry. If the co-founder of Ledger can be targeted in his own home, no one in crypto is exempt from physical security threats.

The kidnapping accelerated an already growing conversation about physical security for crypto executives and wealthy holders. It also highlighted the dark irony of an industry built on digital security being increasingly vulnerable to old-fashioned physical violence.

Balland survived. Many victims of similar attacks have not been as fortunate.
