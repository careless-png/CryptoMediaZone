3:T5e6,Javier Biosca was a Spanish crypto broker and founder of Algorithms Group, accused of running a Ponzi scheme worth over €500 million. In November 2022, he fell from the fifth floor of a hotel in Estepona, Spain. He was dead on impact.

Biosca's death came just three weeks after he had been released on €1 million bail. He had been charged with defrauding thousands of investors through a scheme that promised guaranteed returns on Bitcoin investments. The victims included ordinary Spaniards who had invested their life savings.

The circumstances were complicated by reports that Biosca had been receiving threats from organized crime figures  -  reportedly Russian and Romanian  -  who had lost money in his scheme. Whether his fall was suicide, murder, or accident was never conclusively determined.

On the day of his death, blockchain analysts detected 37,000 BTC moving from wallets associated with his operation to cold storage. Whether this was a coincidence, a dead man's switch, or an accomplice securing assets remains unknown.

For the thousands of victims who lost their savings, Biosca's death meant that any hope of recovering their money through prosecution died with him. The criminal investigation continued but the central figure was gone.
