3:T77c,When the LUNA/UST ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, it wiped out approximately $40 billion in value in less than a week. The algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be safe turned out to be a mathematical death spiral. The financial losses were catastrophic. The human losses were worse.

In Taiwan, a 29-year-old investor who had lost $2 million in LUNA jumped from his apartment building.

In South Korea, a family of three  -  a father, mother, and their 10-year-old daughter Cho Yoo-na  -  drove their car into the sea off Wando Island. Their phone search history showed recent queries for "LUNA coin," "sleeping pills," and "ways to make an extreme choice." The family had reportedly invested heavily in LUNA and lost everything.

In China, a man killed his young daughter, then jumped into the sea holding his wife. She died. He survived.

The crypto subreddit r/cryptocurrency pinned suicide prevention hotlines at the top of the forum. Moderators worked around the clock to identify and reach users expressing suicidal thoughts. In the weeks after the collapse, mental health organizations reported significant spikes in calls from people identifying financial loss as their primary stressor.

Do Kwon, the creator of LUNA, was on social media the day after the crash. He proposed a recovery plan. He did not address the deaths.

These are not abstract losses. A 10-year-old girl is dead because her parents' savings were in an algorithmic stablecoin designed by a man who once tweeted "I don't debate the poor." The gap between crypto's casual irreverence and the gravity of real human consequences has never been more visible than in the aftermath of LUNA.
