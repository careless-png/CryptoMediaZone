3:T653,In December 2022, Park Mo, a South Korean cryptocurrency executive with ties to the Bithumb exchange, was found dead outside his residence. The circumstances pointed to suicide, though full details were not made public by Korean authorities.

Park's death came during the darkest period in crypto market history. The FTX collapse had occurred weeks earlier, sending shockwaves through every corner of the industry. Investigations into crypto companies were accelerating worldwide. South Korean authorities were particularly aggressive in pursuing crypto executives following the LUNA disaster earlier that year.

The pressure on crypto executives in South Korea during this period was extreme. Do Kwon was a fugitive. Multiple LUNA-related investigations were underway. Public anger toward the crypto industry was at an all-time high. Executives faced not only potential criminal liability but intense social stigma in a culture where financial failure carries profound personal shame.

Park's death received less international attention than other crypto-related deaths, partly because the details were kept private and partly because the industry was already reeling from so many crises simultaneously. But for those who knew him, and for the broader Korean crypto community, it was another reminder that the human cost of this industry is measured in more than dollars.
