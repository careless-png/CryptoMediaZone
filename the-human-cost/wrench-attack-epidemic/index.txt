3:T88a,In 2025, the phenomenon known as "wrench attacks"  -  a reference to the xkcd comic about bypassing encryption by hitting someone with a wrench  -  became a full-blown epidemic. At least 72 verified physical attacks against cryptocurrency holders were recorded, a 75% increase from 2024. The total stolen through violence reached $40.9 million.

The methods were medieval. Kidnappings. Home invasions. Waterboarding. Finger amputations. Sexual assault. Murder. In Vienna, a 21-year-old student was beaten and burned alive. In British Columbia, a family was waterboarded. France alone recorded 19 attacks.

The attacks followed a pattern: criminals identified targets through blockchain analysis, social media, or industry connections. They tracked movements, waited for vulnerability, and struck with extreme violence to extract wallet access. Unlike digital hacks, there is no security patch for a wrench.

The epidemic forced a reckoning in an industry that had spent 15 years focused almost exclusively on digital security. Hardware wallets, multi-sig, cold storage  -  none of it matters when someone is holding a knife to your child. The most secure wallet in the world can be opened by fear.

Some victims complied and survived. Others resisted and were killed. Some had nothing to give and were tortured anyway. The randomness and brutality of the attacks created a climate of fear among crypto holders worldwide.

The industry response was fragmented. Some exchanges began offering privacy features. Security consultants marketed "crypto lifestyle protection." Governments struggled to classify and respond to crimes that crossed borders and jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the attacks continued.

This is not a technology problem. It is a human problem. The same transparency that makes blockchain revolutionary also makes wealthy holders visible targets. Until the industry grapples with this reality, the wrench attacks will continue.
