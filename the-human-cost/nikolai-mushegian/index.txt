3:T70a,Nikolai Mushegian was a 29-year-old computer scientist and co-founder of MakerDAO, one of the most important protocols in decentralized finance. On October 28, 2022, he posted a tweet that would become one of the most haunting messages in crypto history. He claimed that the CIA, Mossad, and the "pedo elite" were going to murder him and make it look like an accident.

Hours later, Mushegian was found dead at Condado Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He had drowned. Local police investigated and found no evidence of foul play. The official determination was accidental drowning.

The timing of the tweet and his death sent shockwaves through the crypto community. Some believed he had been targeted. Others pointed to his documented history of mental health struggles and paranoid ideation. Those close to him described a brilliant but troubled mind  -  capable of groundbreaking work in cryptographic systems while simultaneously battling demons that distorted his perception of reality.

Mushegian had donated over $1 million to Carnegie Mellon University. His contributions to MakerDAO and the DAI stablecoin system were foundational. He was deeply respected for his technical abilities even by those who worried about his wellbeing.

The truth of what happened that morning in Puerto Rico may never be fully established. What is clear is that a 29-year-old man with extraordinary talent is gone, and that the intersection of mental health, paranoia, and the high-stakes crypto world continues to claim lives that the industry can ill afford to lose.
