3:T60d,Mircea Popescu was one of Bitcoin's earliest and most controversial large holders. A Romanian programmer and blogger, he had accumulated an estimated 50,000+ BTC over the years, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in cryptocurrency.

In June 2021, Popescu drowned while swimming off the coast of Playa Hermosa in Costa Rica. He was 41 years old. Local authorities ruled it an accidental drowning due to strong currents.

Popescu was a polarizing figure. His blog was influential in early Bitcoin circles but also contained deeply offensive content. He ran MPEx, one of the first Bitcoin stock exchanges, and was known for provocative and often abusive rhetoric. Many in the community had complicated feelings about him.

His death raised the same question that haunted Matthew Mellon's passing: what happens to the keys? An estimated $2 billion or more in Bitcoin may be permanently inaccessible. No recovery plan has been publicly confirmed. The coins may sit in their wallets forever  -  visible on the blockchain but unreachable by anyone.

In a network designed around sovereign ownership, death without key transfer is the ultimate loss. The Bitcoin is not destroyed. It simply becomes part of the permanently lost supply, making every remaining accessible Bitcoin marginally more scarce.
