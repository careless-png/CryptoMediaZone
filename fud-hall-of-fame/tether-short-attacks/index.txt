3:T418,No single entity in crypto has generated more FUD than Tether. The issuer of USDT has been accused of everything from operating without reserves to fabricating dollars out of thin air to single-handedly pumping the entire Bitcoin market.

The coordinated short campaign against Tether became a cottage industry. Hindenburg Research published a report calling Tether a ticking time bomb. Short sellers openly discussed attacking USDT's peg. Each report sent shockwaves through the market. BTC would dip 5-10% on Tether FUD alone.

In 2021, the CFTC fined Tether $41 million for misrepresenting reserves. The company admitted its tokens were not always 100% backed by cash. In 2023, NY AG documents showed Tether had lent money to Bitfinex to cover losses.

And yet, USDT's market cap kept growing. By 2025, it surpassed $130 billion. The peg never broke. Tether reported billions in profits. Both sides were partially right: the shorts were correct about sketchy reserves, but catastrophically wrong about the outcome. The house of cards never fell.5:["slug","tether-short-attacks","d"]
