BTC dropped 12% in an hour. The \"Bitcoin boils the oceans\" narrative was everywhere.\n\nBitcoin mining uses roughly 150 TWh per year  -  about 0.1% of global energy production. Less than tumble dryers use in the US alone. A fraction of the traditional banking system.\n\nOver 55% of mining uses renewable sources. Miners actively seek the cheapest energy, which is often stranded or wasted energy. Methane flaring operations have become a major use case.\n\nThe energy argument ignores the fundamental question: is securing a decentralized, censorship-resistant monetary network worth the energy? Gold mining uses more energy, produces toxic waste, and destroys landscapes. The debate shifted from 'Bitcoin uses too much energy' to 'what kind of energy does Bitcoin use?' The industry became more renewable-powered than most sectors.","timeline":[{"date":"May 2021","event":"Musk tweets Tesla stops BTC payments.
