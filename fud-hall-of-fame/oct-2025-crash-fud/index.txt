Four days later, $19.37 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in what became the largest single-day liquidation event in the history of cryptocurrency. It was bigger than the FTX collapse. Bigger than LUNA. Bigger than the COVID crash. And four months later, the industry still cannot agree on what caused it.

The surface-level explanation is simple. On the afternoon of October 10, with traditional US markets already closed, President Trump posted that he would impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for Beijing restricting rare earth mineral exports. Crypto, the only major market still open, absorbed the full force of the panic. Bitcoin dropped from roughly $121,500 to $107,000 within hours. Altcoins fell harder. Solana lost 40% in minutes. Some tokens briefly printed near zero. But the tariff announcement was the match, not the powder keg.

The powder keg was sitting on Binance.

Binance operates a Unified Account system that allows traders to use assets like USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL as margin collateral. Unlike industry standard practice, which relies on external oracles like Chainlink to determine collateral value, Binance priced these assets using its own internal order book. When markets are calm, the difference is academic. When liquidity evaporates, the difference is catastrophic.

On October 6, Binance had announced it would update its oracle pricing methodology for BNSOL and WBETH. The new system was scheduled to go live on October 14. That created an eight-day window where the old, vulnerable pricing was still active. What happened in that window changed the trajectory of the entire market.

Between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10, roughly $90 million worth of USDe was dumped on Binance. On every other exchange, on Curve, on Aave, the stablecoin held near $1. Chainlink's USDe price feed barely flickered, staying in the $0.992 to $1.00 range. But on Binance's internal order book, USDe crashed to $0.65. WBETH, which had been trading near $4,000, briefly dropped to around $430. BNSOL also lost its peg. Cosmos (ATOM) momentarily printed at $0.001.

Because Binance's margin system treated those internal prices as real, every trader holding USDe-backed positions saw their collateral value marked down by 35% in seconds. Forced liquidations cascaded. The liquidations themselves dumped more collateral onto the same thin order books, driving prices lower and triggering more liquidations. A textbook doom loop.

Making it worse, Binance's systems buckled under load. Internal transfers were delayed from 21:18 to 21:51 UTC. API connections lagged or failed. Traders reported that stop-loss orders did not execute and that the interface froze during the peak of the crisis. They watched their positions get liquidated with no way to add collateral or close trades. Roughly 70% of the day's total damage, around $6.9 billion, happened in that single 40-minute window.

Here is where the story fractures.

Binance published a post-mortem attributing the crash to macroeconomic shock colliding with crowded leverage and vanishing liquidity. The exchange emphasized that approximately 75% of liquidations occurred before the USDe index deviations, framing the stablecoin depeg as a symptom, not the cause. Binance acknowledged two platform-specific incidents, the delayed transfers and the temporary index deviations in USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL, but insisted that its matching engine and risk systems stayed operational throughout. Co-founder Yi He and CEO Richard Teng apologized publicly. The exchange committed to compensating affected users with over $328 million for those impacted by the depeg window, plus an additional $400 million relief fund for traders and institutions wiped out by legitimate liquidations.

Critics told a very different story.

OKX CEO Star Xu accused Binance of running "irresponsible marketing campaigns" that manufactured hidden leverage. He pointed to Binance's USDe Rewards Program, launched on September 22, which offered users up to 12% annualized yield on USDe deposits. The promotion attracted over $5 billion in USDe to Binance. Xu argued that traders swapped USDT and USDC into USDe to chase the yield, then reused USDe as margin collateral, creating a leverage loop that nobody was tracking. When the loop snapped under macro stress, the losses were orders of magnitude worse than they should have been. "People have underestimated the impact of 10/10," Xu wrote. "The incident caused real and lasting damage to the industry."

Ethena Labs founder Guy Young, whose protocol created USDe, pushed back on the idea that the stablecoin itself failed. "No one would have been liquidated on any money market with oracles referencing the deepest pools of liquidity," Young said. USDe was fully collateralized and worth $1 on its primary venue throughout the entire episode. On Curve, its main DeFi liquidity pool, USDe dipped only 0.3% before returning to peg. The crash was contained to Binance. Dragonfly partner Haseeb Qureshi put it bluntly: "USDe did not depeg. Binance did."

Uphold's head of research Dr. Martin Hiesboeck went further, calling the episode "Luna 2" and alleging that it was a targeted attack exploiting a known flaw in Binance's collateral valuation system. He argued that the timing, between the October 6 announcement and October 14 implementation, was "exploited" by actors who opened massive short positions in advance. Blockchain data added an uncomfortable detail: a single trader had begun building enormous short positions on Hyperliquid starting October 9, including a $752.9 million short on Bitcoin and a $353.1 million short on Ethereum. Whether that trader had advance knowledge of the vulnerability or simply read the macro tea leaves remains unknown.

In late January 2026, Cathie Wood brought the controversy back into the spotlight. Speaking on Fox Business, the ARK Invest CEO called 10/10 "the flash crash associated with a software glitch on Binance" and estimated that the total forced deleveraging reached approximately $28 billion. She said the crypto market had spent the prior two to three months working through the aftershocks. Binance co-founder Yi He responded in a now-deleted post: "Cathie Wood isn't a Binance user. We don't serve US individuals or entities. No offense."

Tom Lee of Fundstrat appeared on CNBC and described the core issue as "essentially a bug, a code error," explaining that the exchange relied on internal quotes rather than pulling pricing from across exchanges. He declined to name any of the affected market-making firms, saying only that he was "aware of names."

At a January AMA, CZ called the suggestion that Binance caused the crash "far-fetched," attributing it to systemic leverage and market forces. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek called for regulators to investigate exchanges with high liquidation volumes. Former CFTC regulator Salman Banaei compared 10/10 to the 2010 US stock market flash crash and argued that the event warrants a formal investigation regardless of whether manipulation occurred, noting that "the risk of such investigations deters manipulation."

As of February 2026, the market has not recovered. Order books across major exchanges remain thinner than they were before 10/10. Bid-ask spreads are wider. Market depth is patchier. Bitcoin has fallen from $124,800 to below $70,000 at its worst, with many traders citing the bruised market structure as a direct consequence of that single day. Competitors like Hyperliquid have gained volume and positioned themselves as alternatives. Law firms in Hong Kong and London are exploring legal claims on behalf of affected Binance users.

The question that still has no definitive answer: was 10/10 a macro-driven crash amplified by bad architecture, a coordinated exploit of a known vulnerability, or something in between? Binance says the market broke under pressure. Critics say Binance broke the market. The $19 billion is gone either way. The trust might be too.6:["slug","oct-2025-crash-fud","d"]
