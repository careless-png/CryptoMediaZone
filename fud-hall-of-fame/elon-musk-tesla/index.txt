Bitcoin surged past $48,000. Three months later, Musk reversed course with a tweet about "energy concerns." BTC fell 12% in an hour and continued to $30,000.

But Bitcoin wasn't Musk's only playground. He had been pumping Dogecoin since late 2020 with memes, tweets, and SNL appearances. DOGE rose over 15,000%. He called himself the "Dogefather." When the pump reversed, retail investors who bought the top lost billions.

The pattern was unmistakable: the richest man in the world using 150+ million followers to move crypto markets for reasons never fully transparent. Was it trolling? Manipulation? Genuine conviction followed by change of heart?

The SEC received multiple complaints. Nothing came of them. Musk continued tweeting about crypto intermittently, each time causing measurable price movements. No single individual has had more impact on short-term crypto prices with less accountability.

Tesla eventually sold 75% of its BTC holdings at a loss in July 2022. The entire episode  -  buy, hype, dump, move on  -  became a case study in how celebrity influence intersects with unregulated markets.6:["slug","elon-musk-tesla","d"]
