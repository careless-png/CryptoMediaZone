3:T456,PlusToken was a Chinese crypto Ponzi scheme that operated as a fake "high-yield investment platform" from 2018 to 2019. It promised users 10-30% monthly returns. Over 3 million people deposited an estimated $3 billion worth of BTC, ETH, and EOS.

When the operators disappeared in June 2019, they began systematically dumping the stolen crypto on exchanges. On-chain analysts tracked enormous BTC movements  -  roughly 25,000 BTC flowing through mixers and onto exchanges over several months. The selling pressure was so massive it became a measurable drag on the entire Bitcoin market.

Chainalysis confirmed that PlusToken liquidations were directly correlated with Bitcoin price drops throughout the second half of 2019. BTC fell from $13,800 to below $7,000. The dumping was not random market activity  -  it was the largest coordinated sell-off from a single criminal entity in Bitcoin history.

Chinese authorities eventually arrested the main operators in Vanuatu and sentenced six leaders to 2-11 years in prison. Roughly $4.2 billion in crypto was seized. But three million victims lost their savings.5:["slug","plustoken-dump","d"]
