Its algorithmic stablecoin UST held a $1 peg through a mint-and-burn mechanism with LUNA. When it worked, it looked like magic. When it failed, it was the fastest destruction of wealth in crypto history.\n\nIn May 2022, a large UST sell-off broke the peg. The algorithm responded by minting billions of LUNA to restore it. But each new LUNA token diluted the price further, triggering more selling, which required more minting. A textbook death spiral.\n\nLUNA went from $80 to $0.00001 in 72 hours. $41 billion in market cap vanished. Anchor Protocol, which offered 20% APY on UST, collapsed with it. People lost retirement savings. College funds. Life savings.\n\nThe collapse did not stay contained. Three Arrows Capital, a $10 billion hedge fund, was heavily exposed to LUNA. Its collapse triggered Celsius, Voyager, and BlockFi to freeze withdrawals. The dominos fell all the way to FTX.\n\nDo Kwon tweeted about building \"LUNA 2.0\" days later. The community was not amused.","timeline":[{"date":"2020","event":"Terraform Labs launches UST stablecoin"},{"date":"Apr 2022","event":"LUNA hits $119 ATH.
