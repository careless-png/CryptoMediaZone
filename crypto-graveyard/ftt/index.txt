3:T425,FTT was the native token of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange. It was used for fee discounts, staking rewards, and buybacks. On paper, it was a utility token. In reality, it was the collateral underpinning an $8 billion fraud.

Alameda Research, SBF's trading firm, held billions in FTT as collateral on its balance sheet. When CoinDesk leaked that balance sheet in November 2022, it revealed that Alameda's solvency depended almost entirely on the value of FTT. A token created and controlled by the same person.

Binance CEO CZ tweeted he would sell his remaining FTT holdings. The market panicked. FTT crashed. Alameda became insolvent. FTX froze withdrawals. Within 72 hours, the second-largest crypto exchange was dead.

FTT went from $26 to under $1. Billions in customer funds were missing. SBF was arrested. The token that backed an empire was worthless.

FTT is the clearest example of a circular valuation trap: a company creating its own token, using it as collateral, and then collapsing when the market realized the collateral was imaginary.5:["slug","ftt","d"]
