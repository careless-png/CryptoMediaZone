3:T451,OneCoin was not a cryptocurrency. It was a multi-level marketing scheme wrapped in crypto branding. It had no blockchain. The "coins" were numbers on a SQL database in Bulgaria. Over 3 million people across 175 countries lost a combined $4 billion.

Ruja Ignatova, the self-styled "Cryptoqueen," filled stadiums with believers. She wore designer gowns, quoted fake transaction volumes, and projected PowerPoints full of made-up statistics. The crowds worshipped her. The money flowed.

In 2017, Ignatova boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. She has not been seen since. The FBI added her to their Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Rumors place her everywhere from Russia to a yacht in the Mediterranean. Nobody knows.

Her brother, Konstantin Ignatov, took over and was arrested in 2019. He cooperated with prosecutors. Multiple promoters were convicted. But the Cryptoqueen herself remains at large, living off billions in stolen money.

OneCoin proved that you do not even need actual technology to steal billions in the name of crypto. A confident presenter and a pyramid structure were enough.5:["slug","onecoin","d"]
