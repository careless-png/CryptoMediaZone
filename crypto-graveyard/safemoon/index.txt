3:T467,SafeMoon launched in March 2021 with a novel hook: a 10% tax on every sale. Half went to existing holders as "reflections." Half was burned. The pitch was that selling was expensive, so everyone would hold, and the price would only go up.

It worked spectacularly at first. SafeMoon rocketed to a $5.7 billion market cap. TikTok influencers shilled it relentlessly. The "SafeMoon Army" was one of crypto's most aggressive communities. Celebrities promoted it. The team did AMAs. The vibes were immaculate.

Behind the scenes, the developers were draining liquidity. They siphoned over $200 million from the project's liquidity pool into personal wallets. The 10% sell tax, marketed as a feature for holders, also made it harder for investors to exit as the price declined.

In November 2023, the SEC charged SafeMoon and its executives with fraud. CEO John Karony was arrested. The DOJ followed with criminal charges. The token is now effectively worthless.

SafeMoon's innovation was not financial. It was psychological. It weaponized community identity and exit penalties to keep money flowing in while the founders stole it.5:["slug","safemoon","d"]
