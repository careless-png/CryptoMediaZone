3:T409,BitConnect promised 1% daily returns through a "trading bot" that never existed. New investor money paid old investor returns. The token hit $463. Then the music stopped.

The BitConnect Annual Conference gave the world Carlos Matos. His unhinged speech, screaming "Hey hey heyyyy! Whadamigonnadoo?!" while pumping his fists, became the most-watched crypto video in history. It was simultaneously the peak of the scam and its best eulogy.

In January 2018, Texas and North Carolina regulators issued cease-and-desist orders. BitConnect shut down its lending platform overnight. BCC crashed from $363 to under $1 within hours. Billions in investor funds simply vanished.

The founder, Satish Kumbhani, was indicted on fraud charges by the DOJ. He disappeared. The FBI listed him as wanted. Promoters like Glenn Arcaro pled guilty and were sentenced to prison. Matos became a meme. The investors became cautionary tales.

BitConnect proved that crypto's biggest vulnerability is not code. It is human greed dressed in technical jargon.5:["slug","bitconnect","d"]
