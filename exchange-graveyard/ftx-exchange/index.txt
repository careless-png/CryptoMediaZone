3:T502,FTX was the golden child of crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried built it into a $32 billion empire with celebrity endorsements, a Super Bowl ad featuring Larry David, a stadium naming deal, and political donations that made him the second-largest donor to the Democratic Party.

On November 2, 2022, CoinDesk published a report showing that Alameda Research, SBF's trading firm, held most of its assets in FTT, FTX's own token. Binance CEO CZ tweeted he would sell his FTT holdings. That tweet triggered a bank run.

Within 72 hours, FTX went from $32 billion valuation to bankruptcy. Over 9 million users lost access to their funds. The total customer deficit was over $8 billion. SBF had been using customer deposits to fund Alameda's trades, political donations, and real estate purchases in the Bahamas.

SBF was arrested in December 2022, tried in October 2023, and convicted on all seven counts. He was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. Caroline Ellison, Alameda's CEO and SBF's ex-girlfriend, cooperated and received two years.

FTX's collapse triggered a domino effect that killed BlockFi, Genesis, and dozens of other firms. It was the Lehman Brothers moment for crypto, the single event that proved the industry had replicated every toxic practice it claimed to be replacing.5:["slug","ftx-exchange","d"]
