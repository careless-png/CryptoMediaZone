3:T4e0,Voyager Digital was a publicly traded crypto brokerage that positioned itself as the mainstream-friendly option. Listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, regulated, with a clean app interface. CEO Stephen Ehrlich appeared on CNBC and Bloomberg regularly.

Voyager's big bet was a $650 million loan to Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the hedge fund run by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. When LUNA collapsed in May 2022, 3AC could not repay. Voyager had lent almost all of its customer deposits to a single counterparty with no meaningful collateral.

On July 1, 2022, Voyager suspended withdrawals. Three days later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 3.5 million users lost access to their funds. The platform had $3.5 billion in liabilities and not nearly enough assets to cover them.

Ehrlich had told customers their deposits were FDIC insured. They were not. The FDIC itself issued a cease-and-desist order against Voyager for misrepresenting deposit insurance. Customers who thought their money was as safe as a bank account discovered it was not.

Voyager's bankruptcy became a bidding war. FTX initially won the bid to acquire Voyager's assets, then FTX itself collapsed. Binance.US eventually stepped in. Ehrlich was later charged with fraud by the SEC.5:["slug","voyager","d"]
