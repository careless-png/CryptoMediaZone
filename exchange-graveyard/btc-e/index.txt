3:T506,BTC-e was one of the oldest and largest Bitcoin exchanges, operating from 2011 to 2017. It was known for lax KYC requirements and became the exchange of choice for anyone who did not want to be identified. That included money launderers, ransomware operators, and whoever stole the Mt. Gox Bitcoin.

The exchange was run by Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national. In July 2017, Vinnik was arrested while on vacation in Greece. The DOJ charged him with operating an unlicensed money service business and laundering over $4 billion through BTC-e. The exchange was seized and shut down the same day.

Investigators traced a significant portion of the stolen Mt. Gox Bitcoin through BTC-e. The exchange had effectively served as a laundering operation for the proceeds of the largest crypto hack in history.

Vinnik's arrest triggered a multi-country extradition battle between the US, Russia, and France. France won initially, tried Vinnik, and sentenced him to five years. He was then extradited to the US in 2024 to face additional charges.

BTC-e's shutdown marked the end of an era when exchanges could operate anonymously with no regulation. It was the first major enforcement action that demonstrated law enforcement could shut down even the most deliberately opaque crypto operations.5:["slug","btc-e","d"]
