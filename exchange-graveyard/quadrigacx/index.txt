3:T4e4,Gerald Cotten was the 30-year-old CEO of QuadrigaCX, Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange. In December 2018, he reportedly died of Crohn's disease complications while on his honeymoon in India. His wife reported his death and provided a death certificate.

There was one problem: Cotten was supposedly the only person who knew the passwords to the exchange's cold wallets. When QuadrigaCX tried to access customer funds after his death, they could not. Approximately $190 million in crypto was locked, with no way in.

Investigations later revealed that most of the cold wallets were empty. Cotten had been operating a Ponzi scheme, using new deposits to pay old withdrawals. The "lost passwords" story was a cover for the fact that the money had already been spent.

The case became the subject of a Netflix documentary and spawned one of crypto's wildest conspiracy theories: that Cotten faked his death and is still alive. The death certificate was issued in India, the body was buried in a closed casket, and Cotten had a documented history of fraud under aliases.

In 2020, Ernst & Young's investigation confirmed that Cotten had been misusing customer funds for years. Whether he is dead or alive remains debated in crypto forums to this day.5:["slug","quadrigacx","d"]
