3:T4e8,Cryptopia was a New Zealand-based exchange popular with altcoin traders. It listed hundreds of small-cap tokens that larger exchanges ignored. In January 2019, it was hacked for approximately $16 million. The exchange attempted to reopen but went into liquidation in May 2019.

What followed was a legal nightmare. New Zealand courts had to determine a novel question: who actually owns cryptocurrency held on an exchange? The liquidators argued the coins were company property. Users argued they were personal property held in trust.

In 2020, a New Zealand court ruled that the crypto held on Cryptopia was the property of the users, not the company. This was a landmark decision for crypto law. It established that exchange custody is not the same as ownership.

The liquidation process has dragged on for over five years. Cryptopia had 300,000 users across multiple countries, tiny account balances spread across hundreds of obscure tokens, and incomplete records. Distributing the remaining funds has been an accounting nightmare.

Cryptopia was not a fraud. It was a small exchange that got hacked and could not survive. But its legal aftermath established important precedents about crypto custody and ownership that rippled through global case law.5:["slug","cryptopia","d"]
