3:T4a8,Mt. Gox started as a Magic: The Gathering card trading site. Its name literally stands for "Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange." Mark Karpeles repurposed it for Bitcoin in 2010, and by 2013 it handled 70% of all Bitcoin transactions on Earth.

Then it all fell apart. In February 2014, Mt. Gox halted withdrawals, filed for bankruptcy, and revealed that 850,000 BTC had been stolen. At the time, that was worth about $460 million. By 2024, those same coins were worth over $85 billion.

The collapse was the result of years of mismanagement, poor security, and a hack that went undetected for years. A single vulnerability in the hot wallet had been leaking Bitcoin since at least 2011. By the time anyone noticed, most of the coins were gone.

Karpeles was arrested in Japan in 2015 and charged with embezzlement. He was eventually convicted of falsifying data but acquitted of the more serious charges. Creditors entered a legal nightmare that lasted over a decade. Repayments finally began in 2024.

Mt. Gox remains the defining cautionary tale. It proved that centralized exchanges are single points of failure. The phrase "not your keys, not your crypto" was born from Mt. Gox's ashes.5:["slug","mt-gox","d"]
