Someone took him up on it and ordered two Papa John's pizzas delivered to Hanyecz's house in Jacksonville, Florida.

It was the first known commercial transaction using Bitcoin. At the time, 10,000 BTC was worth about $41. Today those same coins would be worth over $800 million. It is the most expensive pizza order in human history.

Hanyecz does not regret it. He has said in interviews that using Bitcoin for real transactions was exactly the point. If nobody ever spent Bitcoin, it would have no value as a currency. His pizza purchase proved that BTC could be used to buy real things, which was essential for the network's credibility.

May 22 is now celebrated annually as "Bitcoin Pizza Day." Crypto companies run promotions. Pizza brands post Bitcoin memes. The community treats it as a founding holiday.

Hanyecz went on to mine and spend thousands more Bitcoin in the early days. He is not bitter. He understood something that most crypto speculators do not: currencies are meant to be used, not hoarded. His pizza purchase did more for Bitcoin's legitimacy than any amount of holding would have.6:["slug","pizza-day","d"]
