Tokens pegged to the US dollar, like USDT (Tether), USDC (Circle), and DAI (MakerDAO), collectively exceed $150 billion in circulation and regularly process more daily volume than Bitcoin.

Stablecoins solve crypto's biggest usability problem: volatility. You cannot run a business, pay employees, or price goods in an asset that moves 10% daily. Stablecoins provide the stability of dollars with the speed and accessibility of crypto.

Their real-world impact is largest in developing countries. In Argentina, Turkey, Nigeria, and dozens of other nations with unstable currencies, people use USDT to preserve savings against local inflation. It is often easier to access than a US bank account. Stablecoins have become a parallel dollar system operating outside traditional banking.

Tether (USDT) is the dominant player and the most controversial. Critics have questioned whether Tether's tokens are fully backed by dollar reserves. Tether has been fined by regulators and operates with minimal transparency. Despite this, USDT remains the most traded crypto asset by volume.

The stablecoin market represents crypto's clearest path to mainstream utility. While NFTs, metaverse, and Web3 faded, stablecoins quietly became the backbone of global crypto commerce and increasingly, regular commerce as well.6:["slug","stablecoin-era","d"]
