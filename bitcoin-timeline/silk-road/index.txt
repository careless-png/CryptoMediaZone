3:T501,Silk Road was an anonymous marketplace on the Tor network where users could buy drugs, fake IDs, and other contraband using Bitcoin. Founded by Ross Ulbricht (alias "Dread Pirate Roberts") in 2011, it became Bitcoin's first major use case.

At its peak, Silk Road had over 10,000 products listed and generated $1.2 billion in Bitcoin revenue. It proved that cryptocurrency could function as a medium of exchange outside the traditional financial system. This was simultaneously Bitcoin's greatest validation and its biggest PR problem.

The FBI shut down Silk Road in October 2013 and arrested Ulbricht. He was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. He was sentenced to double life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The sentence was widely considered extreme for a non-violent offender who never personally handled drugs. Ulbricht became a cause for libertarians and prison reform advocates. In January 2025, President Trump pardoned Ulbricht as part of a broader pro-crypto policy agenda.

Silk Road's legacy in Bitcoin is complicated. It proved the technology worked but associated it with crime in the public mind. That association took years to shake and still appears in every regulatory hearing about cryptocurrency.5:["slug","silk-road","d"]
