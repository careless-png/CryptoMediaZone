It was the first "halving," a pre-programmed event that occurs every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). It was the moment Bitcoin's deflationary monetary policy went from theory to practice.

The halving is the core of Bitcoin's economic design. Every four years, the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half. This means Bitcoin's inflation rate decreases over time, eventually reaching zero around the year 2140 when the last satoshi is mined.

The first halving set a pattern that has repeated three more times. In the 12 to 18 months following each halving, Bitcoin's price has historically increased dramatically. After the 2012 halving ($12), BTC rose to $1,100. After 2016 ($650), it rose to $20,000. After 2020 ($8,600), it rose to $69,000. After 2024 ($64,000), it rose to $126,000.

Correlation is not causation, and the sample size is only four halvings. But the pattern is the most-watched cycle in crypto. Miners earn less, supply growth slows, and if demand remains constant, price increases. The halving is not a magic button, but it has been the most reliable predictor of macro Bitcoin trends.

The current block reward is 3.125 BTC after the April 2024 halving. The next halving is expected around 2028.6:["slug","first-halving","d"]
