3:T485,On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block. Embedded in the coinbase transaction was a message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

The message was a timestamp proving the block was mined on that date, but it was also a statement of purpose. Bitcoin was created in direct response to the 2008 financial crisis, the bank bailouts, and the monetary system that made them necessary.

The genesis block's 50 BTC reward is unspendable due to a quirk in the code. Whether this was intentional or accidental is debated. Some believe Satoshi deliberately made the first coins unspendable as a symbolic gesture, similar to burying a cornerstone.

The genesis block is Bitcoin's founding document. Every block since traces its lineage back to Block 0. The chain is unbroken. The message encoded in it, a newspaper headline about bank bailouts, is a permanent reminder of why Bitcoin was built.

Over 900,000 blocks have been mined since. The network has never gone down. The genesis block's timestamp, proof of concept, and embedded message remain the most significant 275 bytes in the history of finance.5:["slug","genesis-block","d"]
