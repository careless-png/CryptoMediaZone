By 2024, he was headlining Bitcoin conferences and promising to make America "the crypto capital of the world."

The pivot was dramatic. Trump launched his own NFT collections (which sold out repeatedly). He accepted crypto donations for his campaign. He promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one. He spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville to a standing ovation.

After winning the 2024 election, Trump followed through on several promises. He signed executive orders supporting digital asset development. He pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. He proposed a US Bitcoin strategic reserve.

The crypto industry responded with euphoria. Bitcoin climbed past $100,000. The narrative shifted from "crypto is under regulatory attack" to "crypto has the White House." For the first time, the US president was actively promoting digital assets.

But the relationship was complicated. Trump's trade war with China triggered the October 2025 flash crash that sent Bitcoin tumbling. The same president who promised to be crypto's champion created the macro conditions for its worst single-day liquidation ever. Crypto learned that political allies and market allies are not always the same thing.6:["slug","trump-crypto","d"]
