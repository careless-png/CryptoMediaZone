3:T51e,On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously. It was the most anticipated regulatory decision in crypto history. The Winklevoss twins had first applied for a Bitcoin ETF in 2013. It took over a decade of rejections, lawsuits, and lobbying to get to yes.

The approval was transformative. For the first time, ordinary investors could buy Bitcoin exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, IRAs, and 401(k)s. No wallets, no exchanges, no private keys. Just a ticker symbol.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion in assets. Within the first year, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted over $30 billion in net inflows. The demand exceeded the most optimistic projections.

Bitcoin's price responded. From roughly $46,000 at approval, BTC climbed past $100,000 within the year. The ETFs created a structural bid: every day, as new money flows in, the ETF managers must buy actual Bitcoin on the open market.

The ETF approval also changed Bitcoin's character. It became a mainstream financial product. The same firms that had dismissed Bitcoin for years, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, were now its biggest promoters. The revolution was being packaged and sold by the institutions it was meant to disrupt.5:["slug","etf-approval","d"]
