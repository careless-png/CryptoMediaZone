3:T595,Pig butchering is the fastest-growing financial scam in the world. The name comes from the Chinese phrase "sha zhu pan," meaning to fatten a pig before slaughter. The scammer builds a relationship, earns trust over weeks or months, then introduces a "great investment opportunity" in crypto.

The victim deposits money into a fake trading platform. The platform shows impressive gains. The victim deposits more. When they try to withdraw, the platform demands fees, taxes, or deposits to "unlock" the funds. The money is gone. The relationship was fake. The platform was fake. Everything was fake.

In 2023, the FBI reported $3.9 billion in pig butchering losses in the US alone. The average victim lost $177,000. Many lost their life savings. Victims include professionals, retirees, and people who never considered themselves vulnerable to scams.

The cruelest layer: many of the scammers are themselves victims. Thousands of people, primarily from Southeast Asia, are trafficked to scam compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. They are forced to run these scams under threat of violence. Those who refuse are beaten or sold to other compounds.

The scale is industrial. Scam compounds employ thousands of people, operate 24/7, and generate billions in revenue. The operation combines human trafficking, cryptocurrency, and sophisticated social engineering into one of the most destructive criminal enterprises of the decade.5:["slug","pig-butchering","d"]
