3:T57e,Phishing is the most effective attack in crypto because it targets the weakest link: the human. No smart contract exploit needed. Just a fake website, a convincing email, or a well-timed DM.

The most common phishing method is fake websites. A scammer creates a perfect copy of MetaMask, Uniswap, or OpenSea with a slightly different URL. You connect your wallet. You approve a transaction. Your assets are drained. The approval was a token allowance that gave the attacker permission to move everything.

Social engineering is the sophisticated version. Scammers pose as support agents on Discord, customer service reps on Twitter, or potential employers on LinkedIn. They build trust before asking you to connect a wallet, share a screen, or click a link. The Ronin Bridge hack started with a fake job offer on LinkedIn.

Seed phrase phishing remains depressingly effective. "Enter your 12-word recovery phrase to verify your wallet." No legitimate service will ever ask for this. Yet thousands of people enter their seed phrases into fake forms every month. Once entered, the wallet is drained within seconds by automated bots.

Hardware wallets protect against most phishing attacks but not all. If you sign a malicious transaction on a hardware wallet, the hardware cannot save you. The best defense is slowness. Never click links from DMs. Never approve transactions you did not initiate. Never rush.5:["slug","phishing","d"]
