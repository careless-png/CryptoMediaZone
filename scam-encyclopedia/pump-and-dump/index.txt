3:T4f4,Pump and dump is the simplest scam in crypto. A group of insiders buys a low-cap token cheaply. They coordinate a marketing blitz: social media posts, influencer mentions, Telegram group announcements. The price spikes as retail buyers pile in. Insiders sell at the top. The price crashes. Retail holds the bag.

In traditional markets, pump and dump is a federal crime. In crypto, it happens thousands of times a month with near-zero enforcement. The lack of market manipulation rules for most tokens creates an open playing field for coordinated schemes.

The playbook has evolved. In 2017, it was ICO pumps. In 2021, it was meme coins on Telegram. In 2024-2025, it was influencer-promoted tokens and celebrity coins. The structure never changes. Only the marketing gets better.

Telegram "pump groups" openly advertise. They have tiered memberships: pay more, get the signal earlier. The people who get the signal first are the ones who profit. Everyone else provides their exit liquidity. The group itself is the scam.

The most reliable defense is also the simplest: if someone you do not know is telling you to buy a token urgently, they are selling it to you. Urgency is the single biggest red flag in crypto. Real opportunities do not require immediate action.5:["slug","pump-and-dump","d"]
