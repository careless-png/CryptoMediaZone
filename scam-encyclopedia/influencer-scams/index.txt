3:T527,In 2022, the SEC fined Kim Kardashian $1.26 million for promoting EthereumMax without disclosing she was paid $250,000 to do so. It was a landmark moment, but it barely scratched the surface of influencer-driven crypto fraud.

The business model is straightforward. A token project pays influencers to promote it. The influencer posts a video or tweet saying they "found" a gem. Their audience buys. The project's insiders sell. The influencer already got paid regardless of whether the token survives.

The payments are staggering. Top crypto YouTubers charge $50,000 to $500,000 per video. Twitter influencers charge $10,000 to $100,000 per thread. Very few disclose the payment. Most frame their promotions as "research" or "alpha" they are sharing with their community.

The problem is not that influencers have audiences. The problem is that their incentives are completely misaligned with their followers. The influencer profits from promotion. The follower profits only if the token goes up. The influencer gets paid either way.

After the 2022 bear market exposed dozens of influencer-promoted tokens as scams, some jurisdictions began requiring crypto advertising disclosures. But enforcement is sparse. The "not financial advice" disclaimer at the bottom of every video has become a joke that protects no one.5:["slug","influencer-scams","d"]
