3:T597,The supercycle thesis was simple and seductive: Bitcoin's four-year boom-bust cycle was over. Institutional money, ETFs, and mainstream adoption had permanently changed the market structure. There would be corrections, sure. But no more 80% drawdowns. No more multi-year bear markets. The only direction was up.

In 2021, the evidence seemed compelling. MicroStrategy was buying billions in BTC. Tesla put Bitcoin on its balance sheet. El Salvador made it legal tender. PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard were integrating crypto. The narrative felt airtight.

Then 2022 happened. LUNA collapsed. 3AC imploded. FTX was revealed as a fraud. Bitcoin dropped from $69,000 to $15,500, a 78% drawdown. It was a textbook crypto bear market, every bit as brutal as 2018.

The supercycle believers went quiet. The institutional adoption they pointed to turned out to be concentrated in a handful of companies, many of which were overleveraged. When the tide went out, they were swimming naked too.

The 2025 crash delivered another blow. Despite spot ETFs, digital asset treasuries, and more institutional participation than ever, Bitcoin still dropped over 50% from its peak. The same cycle repeated. The supercycle was just copium dressed up in a suit and tie.

The four-year cycle, which supercycle proponents declared dead, has now played out almost exactly on schedule in 2022 and 2025. The pattern didn't break. It just wore a nicer outfit.5:["slug","supercycle","d"]
