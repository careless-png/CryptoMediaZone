3:T606,In 2021, Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million at Christie's. That single auction convinced millions of people that digital art was the future. Profile picture (PFP) projects exploded. Bored Ape Yacht Club floor prices hit 150 ETH ($400K+). CryptoPunks sold for millions. Everyone was a collector.

The narrative expanded: NFTs would tokenize everything. Real estate. Music royalties. Event tickets. Medical records. Gaming items. The technology was not just for art. It was the infrastructure for a new ownership economy.

At its peak in January 2022, NFT trading volume hit $5.4 billion in a single month. Celebrities launched collections. Brands created digital wearables. Twitter added NFT profile pictures. It felt like the world was shifting.

Then the bear market arrived. NFT volume collapsed 97% from peak. Floor prices of major collections dropped 80-90%. Most PFP projects went to zero. The thousands of "utility" NFTs that promised roadmaps and community benefits delivered nothing.

The "tokenize everything" dream was even more thoroughly destroyed. No meaningful real-world asset tokenization happened through NFTs. The technology's limitations, including high gas fees, poor UX, and lack of legal frameworks, made real-world adoption impractical.

What survived was small and specific: digital collectibles for dedicated communities, on-chain art, and some gaming items. The $5.4 billion monthly market became a $100 million niche. NFTs found their place, but it was a corner of the internet, not the foundation of a new economy.5:["slug","nfts-everything","d"]
