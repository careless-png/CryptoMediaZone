3:T5d8,The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model was created by an anonymous analyst called PlanB. The thesis was elegant: Bitcoin's value could be predicted by its scarcity ratio (existing supply divided by new production). After each halving, production drops, scarcity increases, and price rises.

PlanB's model generated a price chart that showed Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by December 2021. Some versions of the model predicted $288,000. The chart was shared millions of times. It became the foundational tool for Bitcoin price prediction.

For a while, Bitcoin's price tracked the model almost perfectly. This confirmation bias convinced millions that the model was predictive rather than coincidental. "The model says $100K" was treated as near-certainty.

Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November 2021. Close to six figures, but the model required $100K by year-end. It missed. Then Bitcoin crashed to $15,500, more than 80% below the model's prediction. The model didn't just miss the target. It was off by an order of magnitude.

PlanB argued the model was still valid on longer timeframes. Critics pointed out that S2F conflated scarcity with demand. Gold is scarce too, but its price doesn't mechanically follow production rates. The model also ignored that crypto's market dynamics are driven by leverage, sentiment, and narratives, not just supply mechanics.

Bitcoin eventually did hit $100,000 in 2025, years after the model predicted. But a model that is off by four years is not a model. It is a vibe.5:["slug","stock-to-flow","d"]
