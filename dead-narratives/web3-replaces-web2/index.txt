Every app would be decentralized. Users would own their data. Middlemen would be eliminated. The internet would be rebuilt from the ground up.

The pitch was politically appealing. Who doesn't want to own their data? Who likes Big Tech monopolies? Web3 positioned itself as the antidote to surveillance capitalism.

But the products were terrible. Decentralized social networks were slow and empty. Blockchain-based games were ugly and boring. Decentralized storage was expensive and unreliable. Every Web3 app was worse than its Web2 equivalent, and the "own your data" pitch was not enough to overcome the usability gap.

The numbers tell the story. After billions in funding, the total number of daily active users across ALL decentralized applications combined remains under a million. Instagram alone has over 2 billion. The market has spoken: users choose convenience over ideology every single time.

Some Web3 infrastructure proved useful. DeFi found product-market fit for lending, trading, and stablecoins. NFTs had a bubble and a crash but left behind digital collectibles and provenance tracking. These are real, if niche, use cases.

But the grand vision of "Web3 replaces Web2" is dead. The internet was not rebuilt on blockchains. Web2 companies absorbed useful crypto features (payments, tokens) without decentralizing themselves. Crypto did not eat the internet. The internet ate crypto.6:["slug","web3-replaces-web2","d"]
