3:T5e0,Axie Infinity turned gaming into a job. In the Philippines, people quit their day jobs to breed, battle, and trade digital creatures called Axies. At its peak, the game generated $364 million in monthly revenue. Scholarships emerged where investors bought Axie teams and hired players to grind.

The play-to-earn model promised to revolutionize gaming. Instead of paying to play, you earned tokens. Time spent in-game was converted to real money. For people in developing countries, Axie Infinity was paying more than minimum wage. Stories went viral. The narrative was irresistible.

The problem was that the economics were a circle. New players bought tokens to enter the game. Those tokens paid existing players. When new player growth slowed, the income for existing players collapsed. It was a Ponzi with extra steps and cute graphics.

AXS token peaked at $165 in November 2021. By mid-2022, it had fallen below $10. The Ronin bridge hack ($624M stolen by North Korea's Lazarus Group) accelerated the decline. Players who had invested their savings in Axie teams found their digital creatures worthless.

Other play-to-earn games followed the same trajectory. StepN (move-to-earn), Pegaxy (horse racing), and dozens of others launched, attracted players with unsustainable rewards, and collapsed when new user growth dried up.

The lesson was painful: a game economy where everyone earns and nobody spends is not an economy. It is a redistribution scheme that requires perpetual growth to function.5:["slug","play-to-earn","d"]
