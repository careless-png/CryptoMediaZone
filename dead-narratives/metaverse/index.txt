3:T612,In late 2021, Facebook renamed itself Meta and the crypto world went berserk. Decentraland and The Sandbox became the poster children of the "metaverse," virtual worlds where users could buy, sell, and develop digital real estate using crypto tokens.

Virtual land in Decentraland sold for as much as $2.4 million. MANA (Decentraland's token) hit $5.90. SAND (The Sandbox's token) hit $8.40. Samsung, Adidas, and PwC bought virtual properties. The metaverse was the future of social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.

Then someone checked how many people actually used these platforms. A DappRadar report in late 2022 revealed that Decentraland had approximately 38 daily active users. Not 38,000. Not 38 million. Thirty-eight people were wandering around a virtual world that had been valued in the billions.

The Sandbox was slightly better, with a few hundred active users. But the contrast between the valuations and the actual usage was devastating. Brands that had purchased virtual storefronts found themselves building expensive shops in empty malls.

The metaverse narrative died not because the technology was bad (though it was clunky), but because there was no compelling reason for people to be there. Games like Fortnite and Roblox already offered virtual social spaces with hundreds of millions of users, without the crypto overhead.

MANA fell from $5.90 to under $0.30. SAND dropped similarly. The virtual real estate that sold for millions is now essentially worthless. The metaverse became crypto's most embarrassing overreach.5:["slug","metaverse","d"]
