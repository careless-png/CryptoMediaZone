Deposit your crypto, earn up to 18% APY, and forget about traditional banks. CEO Alex Mashinsky appeared in weekly AMAs, wearing his signature Celsius t-shirts, assuring users their funds were safe.

They were not safe. Celsius was using customer deposits to make risky bets on DeFi protocols, staking platforms, and leveraged positions. When the market crashed in 2022, those bets went bad. The company was insolvent for months before anyone found out.

On June 12, 2022, Celsius paused all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. 1.7 million users woke up to find their crypto locked. The message said the freeze was temporary, to "stabilize liquidity." It was not temporary. It was the end.

Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 with a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Court filings revealed that Mashinsky had been withdrawing millions of his own tokens while telling customers everything was fine. He sold $68 million in CEL tokens while simultaneously promoting the token on his weekly streams.

The aftermath was devastating. Ordinary people who followed Mashinsky's "unbank yourself" advice lost their savings. Some had deposited their entire crypto portfolios. The promised 18% APY turned out to be funded by an unsustainable lending model that worked only in a bull market.

Mashinsky was arrested in July 2023 and pleaded guilty to fraud in December 2024. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Some victim funds have been partially distributed through bankruptcy proceedings, but most users received pennies on the dollar.6:["slug","celsius-network","d"]
