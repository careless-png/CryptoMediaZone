Investors deposited Bitcoin, received BCC tokens, and watched their balances grow on screen. For a while, it felt real. The token price soared from pennies to $463. Early investors got paid. The community was ecstatic.

The scheme ran like a textbook Ponzi. New investor deposits funded old investor payouts. There was no trading bot. There was no proprietary algorithm. There was just a spreadsheet showing numbers going up, funded by fresh money pouring in.

The BitConnect Annual Conference in October 2017 became the stuff of legend. Carlos Matos took the stage and delivered a speech so unhinged that it became one of the most viewed crypto videos of all time. "Hey hey heyyyy! Whadamigonnadoo?!" He screamed about his wife not believing in him. He danced. He waved his hands. It was equal parts comedy and tragedy.

On January 16, 2018, BitConnect shut down its lending platform overnight. The token crashed 92% in hours. $2.6 billion in market cap evaporated. Investors who had taken out second mortgages and cashed retirement accounts were wiped out completely.

The founder, Satish Kumbhani from India, vanished. In 2022, the DOJ indicted him on fraud charges, but he remains a fugitive. His alleged partner Glenn Arcaro pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 38 months in prison plus $24 million in restitution.

BitConnect's lasting contribution to crypto was unintentional: it gave the community a permanent meme and a permanent warning about guaranteed returns.6:["slug","bitconnect","d"]
