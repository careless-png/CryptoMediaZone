3:T5f1,OneCoin was not a cryptocurrency. It never had a blockchain. It never had a ledger. It was a multilevel marketing scheme wrapped in crypto buzzwords, and it stole over $4 billion from more than three million people in 175 countries.

The scheme was run by Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian-German woman who styled herself the "Cryptoqueen." She gave TED-style talks at sold-out arenas, claimed OneCoin would replace Bitcoin, and told investors they were getting in on the ground floor of the next financial revolution.

The sales pitch was MLM to the core. Buy "education packages" ranging from $100 to $118,000. Receive "tokens" that could be exchanged on OneCoin's internal platform. Recruit more buyers and earn commissions. The "price" of OneCoin was set by the company itself, not by any market. It went up because they said it went up.

Behind the scenes, there was nothing. No mining. No nodes. No blockchain. The entire operation ran on a SQL database that the company's IT team could edit manually. When investigators finally cracked the system, they found that the "exchange" was a glorified spreadsheet.

In October 2017, Ignatova boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens and was never seen again. She is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list with a $5 million reward. Her brother Konstantin cooperated with authorities and was sentenced to prison. Her co-founder, Karl Sebastian Greenwood, received 20 years.

OneCoin is the largest financial fraud in crypto history that never involved any actual crypto.5:["slug","onecoin","d"]
