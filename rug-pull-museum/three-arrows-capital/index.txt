3:T665,Three Arrows Capital (3AC) was once one of the most respected crypto hedge funds in the industry. Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies were everywhere: on podcasts, at conferences, on Twitter, dropping alpha about the "supercycle" that would send crypto to the moon without looking back.

Behind the confidence was a mountain of leverage. 3AC borrowed billions from lending platforms like Genesis, BlockFi, and Voyager to make massive directional bets on crypto. When prices were rising, the leverage multiplied their returns. They looked like geniuses.

The LUNA collapse in May 2022 started the unraveling. 3AC had a massive position in LUNA that went to zero. But instead of cutting losses, they doubled down elsewhere. When BTC fell below $20,000 in June, the margin calls came. 3AC could not answer them.

The fund owed $3.5 billion to creditors with essentially zero assets remaining. Genesis, which had lent 3AC over $2 billion, was crippled. Voyager Digital, another major lender, filed for bankruptcy. BlockFi was pushed to the brink (and later taken out by FTX's collapse).

3AC's implosion created a contagion event. It was not just one fund failing. It was the interconnected web of crypto lending platforms all discovering simultaneously that their biggest borrower was bankrupt. The dominoes fell for months.

Zhu and Davies fled Singapore. They were eventually tracked down. Zhu was arrested in Singapore airport in September 2023 and sentenced to four months in prison for contempt of court. Both founders later launched a new crypto exchange called OPNX, designed to trade bankruptcy claims. The audacity was breathtaking.5:["slug","three-arrows-capital","d"]
