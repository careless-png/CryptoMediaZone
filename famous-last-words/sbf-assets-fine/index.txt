3:T5b0,On November 7, 2022, as rumors swirled about FTX's solvency, Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted: "FTX is fine. Assets are fine." He followed up with: "FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don't invest client assets."

Every word was a lie. Four days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. $8 billion in customer funds were missing. The company that the SEC, Congress, and every major media outlet had treated as crypto's responsible adult turned out to be running one of the largest financial frauds in history.

The "assets are fine" tweet has become crypto's most infamous last words. It encapsulates the entire FTX saga in seven words. The casual reassurance. The outright deception. The gap between public image and private reality.

What made it worse was context. SBF was not some anonymous dev. He was on the cover of Forbes. He had testified before Congress. He was the second-largest donor to the Democratic Party. He played League of Legends during investor meetings and somehow convinced people this was quirky rather than alarming.

The tweet was deleted after bankruptcy was filed, but screenshots live forever on crypto Twitter. It joins a pantheon of famous corporate lies alongside "the ship is unsinkable" and "we did not have sexual relations."

SBF was convicted on all seven counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison. His "assets are fine" tweet is now the gold standard for why you should never trust founder reassurances during a crisis.5:["slug","sbf-assets-fine","d"]
