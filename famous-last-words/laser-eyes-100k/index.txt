3:T555,In February 2021, a movement swept crypto Twitter. Change your profile picture to have laser eyes. Signal to the world that Bitcoin is going to $100,000 by the end of the year. Politicians, CEOs, influencers, and random anons all joined in. The laser eyes became a tribal badge of conviction.

The conviction was based on the stock-to-flow model, the four-year cycle, and pure vibes. Bitcoin had just broken $50,000. Institutional adoption was accelerating. Tesla had bought $1.5 billion in BTC. The path to $100K seemed not just possible but inevitable.

Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November 2021. Close, but no cigar. Then it crashed. And kept crashing. By June 2022, it was at $17,600. By November 2022, it bottomed at $15,500.

The laser eyes disappeared from profiles faster than the money disappeared from portfolios. The movement became a cautionary tale about consensus herd mentality. When everyone agrees on a price target and uses the same avatar to signal it, the trade is already crowded.

Bitcoin did eventually reach $100,000, but not until 2025. Four years after the laser eyes predicted it. The people who held through the crash and the 2022 bear market were rewarded, but most laser eyes accounts had capitulated long before then. The movement proved that being directionally right but catastrophically wrong on timing is the same as being wrong.5:["slug","laser-eyes-100k","d"]
