3:T564,Ben Armstrong, better known as BitBoy Crypto, was the most followed crypto YouTuber in the world. At his peak, he had 1.4 million subscribers and massive influence over retail trading decisions. When he said "this coin will 100x," thousands of people bought.

The problem was that BitBoy was being paid to say it. He promoted tokens through paid partnerships that he often failed to disclose properly. When the tokens inevitably crashed, his subscribers held the bags while the projects (and BitBoy) had already cashed out.

His channel became a pump machine. New video every day. New "gem" to buy. New "100x moonshot." The thumbnails were always the same: shocked face, rocket emojis, and a number with too many zeros. It was financial content reduced to clickbait.

In 2023, Armstrong was fired from his own company (Hit Network) after allegations of substance abuse and erratic behavior. He was later arrested outside the home of a former business partner. The arrest was live-streamed by bystanders.

The BitBoy saga illustrated a systemic problem in crypto media: the people with the biggest audiences had the biggest conflicts of interest. They were not journalists or analysts. They were marketers with cameras. And their subscribers paid the price.

His channel still exists under new management, but the BitBoy brand became synonymous with irresponsible crypto promotion.5:["slug","bitboy-pump","d"]
