3:T5eb,Do Kwon was the king of crypto Twitter arrogance. When critics questioned whether UST's algorithmic peg could hold, he responded with "I don't debate the poor." When analysts posted threads explaining the death spiral risk, he tweeted "your size is not size." When a reporter asked about risk management, he said LUNA was "mathematically impossible to fail."

These were not offhand comments. This was a pattern. Kwon built a personal brand around dismissing anyone who questioned him. He called skeptics "poor." He bet a CT user $10 million that LUNA would be above $88 in a year. He radiated the kind of absolute certainty that crypto communities worship and regulators fear.

The community ate it up. "Do Kwon is built different." "LUNA is inevitable." "UST to $100B market cap." The louder Kwon got, the more money people put in. His confidence was their conviction.

Then May 2022 arrived. UST depegged. LUNA death-spiraled. $40 billion evaporated in 72 hours. Every dismissive tweet was screenshotted. Every "I don't debate the poor" was thrown back in his face by the same people he had mocked. Some of those people had lost everything.

Kwon fled South Korea. He was caught in Montenegro with fake passports. He was convicted. The man who called everyone poor is now a convicted felon who may spend decades in prison.

His quotes are now the definitive cautionary tale about founder arrogance in crypto. When someone tells you their project cannot fail, they are either lying or delusional. Either way, run.5:["slug","do-kwon-poor","d"]
