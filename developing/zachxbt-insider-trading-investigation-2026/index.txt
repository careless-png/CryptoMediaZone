No charts. No wallet addresses. No name. Just this:

"Major investigation dropping February 26 on one of crypto's most profitable businesses where multiple employees abused internal data to insider trade over a prolonged period of time."

That was enough.

Within hours, prediction markets exploded. Polymarket launched a dedicated contract asking one question: which company? Volume blew past $2 million on day one. By February 24, it had crossed $6 million. Thousands of traders were putting real money behind their guesses, and nobody had a confirmed answer.

This is what ZachXBT does. He does not leak. He does not hint. He announces. And the announcement alone is enough to move markets, crash tokens, and send compliance teams into emergency meetings across the industry.

The post described the target as "one of crypto's most profitable businesses." That phrase did the heavy lifting. It immediately eliminated the mid-tier projects, the struggling protocols, the zombie chains running on fumes. This was about a money machine. A real one.

Crypto Twitter did what it does best. Within minutes, the thread was flooded with guesses. By the end of the day, Polymarket had odds on over a dozen companies. The frontrunners tell a story about where the market thinks the bodies are buried.

Meteora sits at the top. 43% odds. The Solana-based liquidity protocol has been printing money as the backbone of meme coin launches, including the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. It handles the liquidity pools. It sees the flows before anyone else. If employees at a company like that wanted to front-run token launches, they would have had every opportunity. Co-founder Ben Chow has already faced community scrutiny over how launch liquidity gets structured. MET is trading at an all-time low of $0.17, down over 6% in 24 hours. The market is not waiting for the report.

Axiom sits at 15%. Another Solana infrastructure play. Less public scrutiny, but the kind of behind-the-scenes protocol that would have access to exactly the type of data ZachXBT described.

Pump.fun started as an early favorite but has faded to around 9%. The memecoin factory generated over $500 million in revenue and processes thousands of token launches daily. Every one of those launches is a potential insider trade if someone on the inside knows what is about to trend.

MEXC and World Liberty Financial hover in the single digits. MEXC because of persistent rumors about listing behavior and whale coordination. WLFI because of its political ties to the Trump family and the fact that its USD1 stablecoin briefly slipped to $0.98 on February 23, the same day ZachXBT posted. Coincidence, probably. But crypto does not believe in coincidence.

Jupiter, Binance, Hyperliquid, Wintermute, Coinbase, Tether - all listed. All in the low single digits. The market thinks it is someone smaller, hungrier, and closer to the memecoin food chain than the legacy giants.

ZachXBT is not a journalist. He is not a regulator. He is an anonymous on-chain investigator who has, time and again, produced evidence that moved faster and hit harder than anything the SEC or DOJ managed to assemble. His past work has led directly to frozen funds and law enforcement action. When he says he has something, the smart money takes it seriously.

The phrase "multiple employees" is the part that should worry people. This is not about one rogue trader with a hot wallet. This is alleged systemic abuse. Multiple people, over a prolonged period, using internal data to trade ahead of the public. If the evidence holds up, this is not a scandal. It is a structural failure.

In traditional finance, this would trigger an immediate investigation by the SEC, trading halts, and potential criminal referrals. In crypto, it triggers a Polymarket contract and a bunch of people shorting tokens on Hyperliquid. One trader created a fresh Polymarket wallet, spent $5,891 betting on Meteora, then deposited $11,500 into Hyperliquid and opened a 3x short on MET. That is how crypto processes risk now. Not through regulators. Through prediction markets and leverage.

As of February 25, 2026, no company has been officially named. No evidence has been published. No one has been charged with anything. What we have is a single post from someone with a track record of being right, and an entire industry trying to price in information that does not exist yet.

Some projects have responded. Starknet posted a joke video saying "one of crypto's most profitable businesses can't be us." WLFI denied any connection and blamed a separate incident on a "coordinated attack" against their X accounts. Most of the suspected companies have said nothing.

The report drops February 26. When it does, one of two things will happen. Either ZachXBT delivers wallet-level proof of systematic insider trading at a major protocol, and the fallout will be measured in hours and hundreds of millions of dollars. Or the evidence falls short of the hype, and the tokens that have been bleeding for three days stage a violent reversal.

Either way, the damage is already happening. MET is at all-time lows. PUMP is down. WLFI's stablecoin wobbled. The investigation has not even been published yet, and it has already cost the suspected companies real money. That is the power of a reputation built on receipts.

February 26. Set your alarms.6:["slug","zachxbt-insider-trading-investigation-2026","d"]
